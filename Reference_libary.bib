However, the inadequate reporting of experimental detail, combined with the frequent use of flawed protocols is leading to the publication of papers that may not be technically appropriate. We take the view that this problem requires the delineation of a more transparent and comprehensive reporting policy from scientific journals. This editorial aims to provide practical guidance for the incorporation of absolute minimum standards encompassing the key assay parameters for accurate design, documentation and reporting of qPCR experiments (MIQE précis) and guidance on the publication of pure 'reference gene' articles.

	abstract = {The cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus uses both a protein phosphorylation cycle and a transcription–translation cycle to generate circadian rhythms that are highly robust against biochemical noise. We use stochastic simulations to analyze how these cycles interact to generate stable rhythms in growing, dividing cells. We find that a protein phosphorylation cycle by itself is robust when protein turnover is low. For high decay or dilution rates (and compensating synthesis rates), however, the phosphorylation-based oscillator loses its integrity. Circadian rhythms thus cannot be generated with a phosphorylation cycle alone when the growth rate, and consequently the rate of protein dilution, is high enough; in practice, a purely posttranslational clock ceases to function well when the cell doubling time drops below the 24-h clock period. At higher growth rates, a transcription–translation cycle becomes essential for generating robust circadian rhythms. Interestingly, although a transcription–translation cycle is necessary to sustain a phosphorylation cycle at high growth rates, a phosphorylation cycle can dramatically enhance the robustness of a transcription–translation cycle at lower protein decay or dilution rates. In fact, the full oscillator built from these two tightly intertwined cycles far outperforms not just each of its two components individually, but also a hypothetical system in which the two parts are coupled as in textbook models of coupled phase oscillators. Our analysis thus predicts that both cycles are required to generate robust circadian rhythms over the full range of growth conditions.},

	abstract = {Twelve epipelagic copepod species were reviewed to compare their adaptations to the short primary production season and low temperatures which characterise the Southern Ocean. The species show a spectrum of adaptations, but three broad life cycle strategies were defined: (1) herbivorous in summer, a short reproductive period and winter diapause at depth (Calanoides acutus and possibly Ctenocalanus citer); (2) predominantly omnivorous/detritivorous diet, an extended period of feeding, growth and reproduction and less reliance on diapause at depth (Metridia gerlachei, Calanus propinquus, Calanus simillimus, Oithona similis, Microcalanus pygmaeus, and possibly Oncaea curvata and Oithona frigida); (3) overwintering and feeding within sea ice as early nauplii or copepodids (Stephos longipes and Paralabidocera antarctica). The large species Rhincalanus gigas appears to be intermediate between strategies (1) and (2). Contrasting species from groups (1) and (2), namely C. acutus and O. similis, were selected for more detailed comparison. For C. acutus, maximum (probably food saturated) feeding and egg production rates are well below equivalent values for Calanus spp. at lower latitudes. Likewise, summer growth and moulting rates are slower, and the growth season of this herbivore is only 2–4 months. Therefore, both the low summer temperatures and short primary production season seem to dictate a long (∼1 year) life cycle for C. acutus. A collation of data on O. similis revealed that its abundance increases about tenfold from the Antarctic shelf northwards to the Polar Frontal Zone, where abundances are similar to those in temperate and tropical shelf seas. In contrast to C. acutus, O. similis appears to remain in the epipelagic and reproduce there year-round, although the food sources which sustain this are still uncertain.},

Considerable progress has been made regarding quantitative aspects of krill biology. This detailed knowledge about krill population parameters is nec- essary to answer questions about the importance of euphausiids to energy flow through certain ecosystems. This infor- mation also helps in assessing the importance of seasonal or long-term climate effects on variation in euphausiid populations because variability is not simply noise. Hypotheses have been developed as to how large seasonal or latitu- dinal environmental changes affect species survival strategies in poor conditions and maintenance of a stable population level. This paper discusses aspects of the spatial distribution with regard to seasonal and interannual changes, develop- ments to define genetically distinct populations, and results of long-term variability in krill abundance and biomass for various species in different geographical locations.},

Phylogenetic analy- sis of several Antarctic and sub-Antarctic Euphausia species indicates the importance of dispersal in determining the present-day geographic distribution. Dating speciation events suggest that the formation of the Antarctic Convergence, the oceanographic barrier isolating the Southern Ocean, may have played a role in separating the ancestral Antarctic and sub-Antarctic lineages. Intraspecific data show that the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is characterized by weak genetic differentiation, whereas the northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) is more structured showing dis- crete genetic pools. This difference can be explained, at least partly, by the oceanographic conditions in the areas in- habited by the two species.},

	abstract = {There has been a long-term interest in the population genetics of Antarctic krill species because of their ecological and economic importance. The possibility that there are distinct genetic stocks of these species would affect the design of management strategies for their conservation. A recent resurgence of interest in identifying distinct stocks of swarming krill species has been driven by the development of genetic technologies that are more sensitive to subtle population structure than older methods. Previous studies of the population genetics of the Antarctic species Euphausia crystallorophias and E. superba and the boreal species Meganyctiphanes norvegica that used allozymes found no evidence of genetic population structure. More recent investigations using sequence variation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have exposed genetic differentiation between samples taken from different parts of each species range. However, the underlying assumption of these studies that differentiation between samples is caused primarily by restricted gene fl ow between widely separated sampling sites may be incorrect. Our recent study of E. crystallorophias mtDNA variation has indicated that there is signifi cant genetic differentiation between samples taken within one region. This has important implications for the design of future studies of krill population genetics, which must be able to accommodate this sympatric variance component as well as variance attributable to differences between regions. Genetic differentiation between stocks of krill in different regions therefore can not be adequately assessed unless multiple samples are taken from each region.},

	abstract = {Many marine ecosystems exhibit a characteristic wasp-waist structure, where a single species, or at most several species, of small planktivorous fishes entirely dominate their trophic level. These species have complex life histories that result in radical variability that may propagate to both higher and lower trophic levels of the ecosystem. In addition, these populations have two key attributes: (1) they represent the lowest trophic level that is mobile, so they are capable of relocating their area of operation according to their own internal dynamics; (2) they may prey upon the early life stages of their predators, forming an unstable feedback loop in the trophic system that may, for example, precipitate abrupt regime shifts. Experience with the typical boom-bust dynamics of this type of population, and with populations that interact trophically with them, suggests a predator pit type of dynamics. This features a refuge from predation when abundance is very low, very destructive predation between an abundance level sufficient to attract interest from predators and an abundance level sufficient to satiate available predators, and, as abundance increases beyond this satiation point, decreasing specific predation mortality and population breakout. A simple formalism is developed to describe these dynamics. Examples of its application include (a) a hypothetical mechanism for progressive geographical habitat expansion at high biomass, (b) an explanation for the out-of-phase alternations of abundances of anchovies and sardines in many regional systems that appear to occur without substantial adverse interactions between the two species groups, and (c) an account of an interaction of environmental processes and fishery exploitation that caused a regime shift. The last is the example of the Baltic Sea, where the cod resource collapsed in concert with establishment of dominance of that ecosystem by the cods wasp-waist prey, herring and sprat.},

We projected growth trajectories for individual krill within cohorts and esti-mated how total biomass in an area available to both predators and the fishery may vary from year to year simply due to fluctuations in temperature. We used an existing temperature-dependent growth model and a time series of temperature data (1970 to 2004) for 2 regions in the Southern Ocean: (1) around the Antarctic Peninsula, and (2) around the island of South Georgia. The growth model predicted increasing individual size within a cohort (in terms of length and weight) with increasing temperature in the cooler Antarctic Peninsula region and decreasing individual size with increasing temperature in the warmer South Georgia region. Years with many cohorts of small individuals in the population resulted in biomass well below average, whereas years with many cohorts of large indi-viduals resulted in biomass well above the average, suggesting that temporal changes in Southern Ocean temperatures may have profound effects on the total biomass in an area that is available to both predators and the fishery. Moreover, the effects of a potentially warming Southern Ocean on krill biomass will likely be more pronounced in the warmer regions occupied by krill.},

	abstract = {Antarctic coastal krill (Euphausia crystallorophias) were collected in Austral winter (July/August) 1999 in the Mertz Glacier polynya off the coast of East Antarctica and were compared to krill collected off East Antarctica during summer in 1996 and 2001 and spring 1999. A range of experiments and measurements were conducted to assess their relative condition in winter and summer. Krill collected in winter had pale yellowgreen digestive glands, indicating some recent feeding activity. The size of the digestive glands was small relative to those of krill caught in summer. This indicates that feeding had been occurring at low levels during the collection period. Growth rates, measured using the instantaneous growth rate methodology, were close to zero in winter (range 5\% to 7\% per moult). This was an indication that some food had been available during the period of the moult cycle. Growth rates in spring ranged from 0.5\% to +8.7\% per moult and from 4\% to 12\% per moult in the summer. The mean length of the winter moult cycle (68 days) was considerably greater than the measured intermoult period in summer and spring (2433 days). Lipid levels were low in winter, less than 5\% of body weight, compared to summer levels of 15\% (dry weight). Winter krill were richer in wax esters and poorer in polar lipids than specimens collected in summer. Krill in winter were lacking in C16 PUFA that are markers of the phytoplankton diet common in summer krill. Krill caught in the winter had significantly higher levels of 20:1 and 22:1 fatty acids (2.3\%) and alcohols (8.1\%) than krill sampled in summer (0.2\%, 0\%), indicating a shift to a carnivorous diet. Results from this study suggest that E. crystallorophias respond to low food abundance during the winter through metabolic and physiological processes. These processes were reflected in a decrease in growth rate and a significant increase in the intermoult period. The process of lipid utilisation and switching to a carnivorous/detrital type diet are also overwintering strategies employed by this species.},

Circadian clocks are perhaps the best characterized biological oscillators and they exist in virtually all light-sensitive organisms. In mammals, they influence nearly all aspects of physiology and behavior, including sleep-wake cycles, cardiovascular activity, endocrinology, body temperature, renal activity, physiology of the gastro-intestinal tract, and hepatic metabolism. The master pacemaker is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei, two small groups of neurons in the ventral part of the hypothalamus. However, most peripheral body cells contain self-sustained circadian oscillators with a molecular makeup similar to that of SCN (suprachiasmatic nucleus) neurons. This organization implies that the SCN must synchronize countless subsidiary oscillators in peripheral tissues, in order to coordinate cyclic physiology. In this review, we will discuss some recent studies on the structure and putative functions of the mammalian circadian timing system, but we will also point out some apparent inconsistencies in the currently publicized model for rhythm generation.},

Like many model systems, advances in DNA-sequencing methodologies have led to a large amount of genomics-related projects. The purpose of this article is to highlight the genome projects and functional genomics (transcriptomics) projects that are currently underway in crustacean biology. Specifically, we have surveyed the amount of publicly available DNA sequence data (both genomic and EST data) across all crustacean taxa for which a significant number of DNA sequences have been generated. Several ongoing projects are presented including the ecology of invasive species, thermal physiology, ion and water balance, ecology and evolutionary biology, and developmental biology},

Due to the observed climate warming, its numbers are being reduced to the advantage of a sibling Atlantic species Calanus finmarchicus. We developed and characterized the first set of microsatellite markers in this species to investigate its population genetic structure and dispersal capabilities. Nine polymorphic loci displayed an average of 7.3 alleles (range between 2 and 13) and the levels of expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.039 to 0.806. These provide a valuable tool to understand present connectivity patterns across Arctic regions, look for signatures of past climate effects and predict the response to future climate-driven environmental changes. Additionally, due to the cross-amplification with C. finmarchicus, the markers can be used to discriminate between these sibling species.},

We used lipid biomarkers to quantify feeding patterns and relate the variability in biomarkers to environmental conditions that structure the phytoplankton community. Fatty acid profiles varied among years, with some years dominated by lipids indicative of herbivory, while other years were indicative of greater omnivory. Principal component analysis of 60 fatty acids showed that 3 principal components (PCs) explained approximately 50\% of the variability in fatty acid profiles. The first PC separated the fatty acid indicators along a herbivory-omnivory-carnivory gradient. Correlations between the gradient of herbivory and carnivory, as summarized by the first PC, were found with both winter sea ice extent (r = 0.55, p {\textless} 0.01) and with ENSO conditions the previous winter (r = 0.88, p {\textless} 0.001). These findings suggest that climatic conditions during the late winter precondition the pelagic ecosystem around the Antarctic Peninsula, impacting the trophic ecology of Antarctic krill the following summer.},

The basin-wide circulation features a double-cell structure of the Weddell Gyre with maximum transports close to recent observations.

In this study, seasonal dynamics in abundance were only evident in A. glacialis. Respiration rates did not differ significantly between summer and winter in any species, indicating that the under-ice habitat is a comparatively stable environment in terms of seasonal variations. The assessment of total lipids and fatty acid biomarkers revealed differences in feeding behaviour and overwintering strategy among the amphipod species. A. glacialis is strictly herbivorous, feeding on ice-algae at the underside of the ice during the productive season. The species overwinters in an active state, fuelled at least partly by internal lipid reserves stored during summer. O. glacialis switches from a predominantly herbivorous diet in summer to metazoan prey, including planktonic copepods, in winter, so that lipid catabolism is less important to winter survival. The congener O. nanseni relies on an opportunistic omnivorous diet throughout the year, with a higher proportion of metazoan prey during summer compared to O. glacialis. G. wilkitzkii is able to exploit a wide spectrum of food sources, from predominantly ice algae in summer to more ice fauna and planktonic copepods in winter. This species partly meets its energy requirements by using internal lipid reserves during winter.},

The resulting sequence is a relatively low quality fragment whose length is limited by current technology to approximately 500 to 800 nucleotides. Because these clones consist of DNA that is complementary to mRNA, the ESTs represent portions of expressed genes.

fraction of metozoan food. Among these was Euphausia superba. Seven
groups were carnivorous, including species of copepods (1), chaetognaths
(3), and fishes (5). Copepods were the most frequent food of carnivores;
however krill also were important in the diets of three fish species.
Among small-particle grazers, phytoplankton occurred more frequently in
guts of individuals from open water; carnivory was more in evidence in
samples collected under the pack ice. Regional comparisons of material
taken on this and several previous cruises indicate that, in most of the
dominant species, diets remain relatively consistent with respect to
major food categories. Seasonal impact on feeding dynamics appears to be
great: the guts of grazing species were generally much more full (visual
evidence) during summer bloom conditions than during the autumn. The
following trophic sequence is suggested for grazing zooplankton species
in ice-covered regions of the Antarctic: (1) Active small-particle
grazing during the summer bloom period; (2) reduced ingestion rates in
autumn as primary production declines and the system becomes more
oligotrophic, with some species augmenting grazing with carnivory; (3)
descent of zooplankton biomass species into the mesopelagic zone in late
autumn-early winter with feeding largely terminated. The sequence
applies to the dominant zooplankton biomass species. Feeding dynamics
and vertical distribution of several of the important larger sized
grazing species, such as Euphausia superba and Salpa thompsoni, remain
largely unknown},

	abstract = {The spatial distribution of Antarctic minke whales in the Ross Sea with relation to spatial distributions of their prey – krill – was investigated in this study using generalized additive models (GAMs). Spatial distributions of two species of krill (ice and Antarctic krill) were estimated by GAMs. Three abiotic factors – distance from the continental shelf break (800 m isobaths), the mean temperature and salinity from the surface to 200 m (MTEM-200 and MSAL-200), and latitude and longitude – were used as covariates for models of krill. Estimated spatial distributions of krill were then used with other covariates to model the spatial distribution of Antarctic minke whales. In the selected model of Antarctic minke whales, Antarctic krill were more influential than ice krill. The number of Antarctic minke whales increased as the density of Antarctic krill increased to around 1.5 g m−2. Beyond that, the number of Antarctic minke whales decreased as the density of Antarctic krill increased. High densities of the Antarctic minke whales were estimated along the sea ice edge in the eastern part of the Ross Sea. Specifically, the densities were high in the north of the continental shelf break where low MTEM-200 and MSAL-200 and intermediate densities of Antarctic krill were observed. Further data collection is needed to investigate interannual variations and trends in their relationship. The results show that the spatial distribution of Antarctic minke whales is a function of longitude, distance from the shelf break, oceanographic condition (temperature and salinity), and densities of ice and Antarctic krill.},

	abstract = {Diel vertical migration (DVM) is a ubiquitous phenomenon in marine and freshwater plankton communities. Most commonly, plankton migrate to surface waters at dusk and return to deeper waters at dawn. Up until recently, it was thought that DVM was triggered by a relative change in visible light intensity. However, evidence has shown that DVM also occurs in the deep sea where no direct and background sunlight penetrates. To identify whether such DVM is associated with latitudinal and seasonal day light variation, one and a half years of recorded acoustic data, a measure of zooplankton abundance and movement, were examined. Acoustic Doppler current profilers, moored at eight different sub-tropical latitudes in the North-Atlantic Ocean, measured in the vertical range of 500–1600 m. DVM was observed to follow day length variation with a change in season and latitude at all depths. DVM followed the rhythm of local sunrise and sunset precisely between 500 and 650 m. It continued below 650 m, where the deepest penetrable irradiance level are {\textless}10−7 times their near-surface values, but plankton shortened their time at depth by up to about 63\% at 1600 m. This suggests light was no longer a cue for DVM. This trend stayed consistent both across latitudes and between the different seasons. It is hypothesized that another mechanism, rather than light, viz. a precise biochemical clock could maintain the solar diurnal and seasonal rhythms in deep sea plankton motions. In accordance with this hypothesis, the deepest plankton were consistently the first to migrate upwards.},

We investigated whether annual seawater migration is preceded by changes in hyposmoregulatory capacity, intermediary metabolism, and the plasma levels of hormones known to play a role in salmonid seawater preadaptation (smoltification). Wild, anadromous Arctic char were sampled in their overwintering lake in April and May and during the period of downstream migration in June. Our results demonstrate a fourfold seasonal increase in gill Na+/K+ ATPase activity, with maximum levels in descending migrants that also dis-played prime hyposmoregulatory capacity. Hepatosomatic index and activities of key liver enzymes also increased dur-ing spring, indicating a general increase in liver metabolic capacity. These changes were accompanied by increased plasma cortisol and thyroxine levels, decreased plasma growth hormone levels, and unchanged plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor-I and 3,5,3-triiodothyronine. Our results indicate that wild, anadromous Arctic char resmoltify every spring, and this involves a shift from an energy-conserving overwintering state to a state where they become osmoti-cally and metabolically prepared for their annual feeding migration to seawater.},

Microalgae, including diatoms, synthesise biological macromolecules such as lipids, proteins and carbohydrates for growth, reproduction and acclimation to prevailing environmental conditions. Here we show that three key species of Southern Ocean diatom (Fragilariopsis cylindrus, Chaetoceros simplex and Pseudo-nitzschia subcurvata) exhibited phenotypic plasticity in response to salinity and temperature regimes experienced during the seasonal formation and decay of sea ice. The degree of phenotypic plasticity, in terms of changes in macromolecular composition, was highly species-specific and consistent with each species’ known distribution and abundance throughout sea ice, meltwater and pelagic habitats, suggesting that phenotypic plasticity may have been selected for by the extreme variability of the polar marine environment. We argue that changes in diatom macromolecular composition and shifts in species dominance in response to a changing climate have the potential to alter nutrient and energy fluxes throughout the Southern Ocean ecosystem.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.dsr2.2004.07.003},
	abstract = {The Antarctic marginal ice zone is an important oceanic front separating the pack-ice and open-water environments. During summer, the retreating pack ice creates a meltwater lens in the euphotic zone, allowing primary producers and microheterotrophs to flourish in a discrete bloom just seaward of the retreating ice edge that lasts about 60 days. The purpose of the present study was to see if the ice-edge bloom had a discernible effect on the metabolism and physiological condition of Antarctic micronekton similar to that observed in zooplankton species. We also wished to assess the importance of the summer season to species' life cycles. Two major data sets were collected on 25 species in the following taxonomic groups: amphipods, cephalopods, decapods, euphausiids, isopods, mysids, ostracods, and polychaetes. The first data set described the metabolic rates of individuals in areas of the marginal ice zone with widely different levels of chlorophyll biomass to investigate the effect of the ice-edge bloom on metabolism. Additionally, summer metabolic rates were compared with data from other seasons. The second data set detailed the levels of protein, water, ash, \{RNA\} and DNA, and the activities of metabolic enzymes (citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase) to examine the efficacy of biochemical indices as predictive tools for metabolism. Results suggested that the mobility of the micronektonic species eliminated most direct effects of the bloom on metabolism. Individuals captured in very different productivity regimes showed few significant differences in the metabolic indicators listed above. Isolated cases of changes in body composition and enzyme activity, however, implied that longer-term effects of the bloom may be exhibited. Seasonal increases in metabolism from winter to summer were observed in the euphausiids Euphausia superba, E. triacantha, and Thysanoessa macrura and the amphipod Vibilia stebbingi. It was concluded that the seasonal shifts were indicative of a type 2 or compromise overwintering strategy whereby metabolism drops without an accompanying dormant state. Protein content and \{MDH\} activity were found to be the best predictors of respiration rate, while nucleic acid measures only correlated with respiration in immature specimens.},

Activity stress in both species had no effect on plasma catecholamine and cortisol levels, splenic mass, and on the haematological variables in B. saida. In contrast, heat stress caused a significant rise in circulating noradrenaline and adrenaline levels in B. saida, accompanied by a significant increase in haematocrit and haemoglobin concentrations, at constant plasma cortisol levels, red blood cell count and splenic mass. A concomitant rise in blood lactate concentrations indicated that heat-stressed B. saida were hypoxaemic. The capacity to synthesise catecholamines in B. saida was 38\% of the value in M. scorpius, but similar to the values for Antarctic notothenioids. The lack of any adrenergic response to activity stress suggests that dominance of cholinergic control of the cardiovascular system may not be restricted to Antarctic notothenioids. Rather, the stress response in B. saida appears to be intermediate between Antarctic and temperate teleosts, in keeping with their relatively recent occupation of cold Arctic waters.},

While the IP was stable over the period (range of individual means; 25.6-29.6 days), both BL and maturity changed greatly from one specimen to the next. Reversible modes shown in BL and maturity suggest that neither parameter is a good indicator of chronological age in this animal.

	abstract = {Since the Discovery Investigations of the 1920s and 1930s, seawater temperatures have increased in the Atlantic sector by 1\&\#xa0;$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C; greater than the global mean rise. The aims of this paper were first to rescue the Discovery macrozooplankton data, second to provide quantitative baseline distribution maps, relating these to indices of temperature and food. Our third aim was to use the relationships we derived between abundance and temperature to project the potential affect of a 1\&\#xa0;$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C warming on the Discovery era distribution patterns. Based on the 1\&\#xa0;m ringnet data retrieved from 615 stations (NovMarch), four taxa comprised {\textgreater}90\% of the Antarctic macrozooplankton abundance: Rhincalanus gigas, Thysanoessa spp., Euphausia superba, and Chaetognaths. Most of the taxa, especially the more abundant ones, were warm water species penetrating into Antarctica and thus total macrozooplankton abundance decreased about 100-fold from 50$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$S to 70$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$S. While temperature correlated best with distribution at this large scale, food availability (proxied by a present-day satellite-based Chlorophyll a climatology) had a secondary effect, with the major euphausiids Euphausia superba and Thysanoessa spp. concentrated in high chl a areas. A modelled uniform 1\&\#xa0;$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C temperature rise produced a poleward shift for all taxa, but the Antarctic continent blocked this re-adjustment for the high latitude species, constricting their predicted range. More widespread polar/sub-polar species were predicted to increase their penetration into Antarctica by 412$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$ in latitude, whereas the poleward shift in potential range of sub-Antarctic taxa were limited by the steep temperature gradient across the Antarctic Polar Front (APF). However, within the Scotia Sea the relatively warm temperatures of the northern Antarctic Zone, abundant food due to iron fertilisation and intense eddy activity provide a gateway for northern species to penetrate south of the APF. Our model predictions, based on measured distributional ranges and observed temperature increases, provide a yardstick with which to compare modern day data compilations and assess the potential effects of future temperature increases.},

	abstract = {The marine copepod, Calanus finmarchicus, is a crucial component of the pelagic food web in the North Atlantic and peripheral seas where it is a major player in biogeochemical cycles and the productivity of commercially important fisheries. A key stage in its life cycle is the emergence of the pre-adult, copepodite developmental stage five (CV) from a period of overwintering dormancy, known as diapause. As is the case in many insect species, diapause is also likely to be under endocrine control in C. finmarchicus. To investigate the hormonal regulation of diapause behaviour of stage CV C. finmarchicus, the expression of three key genes: ecdysone receptor (EcR), retinoid X receptor (RXR) and an A-type allatostatin (A-type AST), were measured in specimens collected at monthly intervals from Loch Etive, a ca. 150m deep sea loch on the west coast of Scotland, between June 2006 and May 2007. The full length RXR gene was cloned and sequenced from C. finmarchicus, and was found to share 49-53\% total identity with equivalent genes encoding proteins from other crustaceans, and {\textgreater}80\% identity in the DNA binding domain with other crustaceans, insects and vertebrates. EcR expression was least in December when the animals are expected to be in diapause, but began to increase in January, when the animals were terminating diapause. Concomittant with the rise in EcR in January was low expression of A-type AST and high expression of RXR},

The data reveal that these stages of development of the 3 species can be discriminated on the basis of the \% of 22:1n-11 fatty alcohol in their large levels of wax esters, with C. hyperboreus having the highest \% followed by C. finmarchicus and then C. glacialis. Equally, C. hyperboreus has the lowest \% of 20:1n-9 fatty alcohol in its wax esters with C. finmarchicus having a higher \% and C. glacialis the highest \%. Relatively minor differences occur in the fatty acid compositions of the wax esters of the 3 species, which consisted principally of 20:1n-9 (15 to 18\%) and 22:1n-11 (10 to 15\%), together with the diatom-derived fatty acids 16:1n-7 (20 to 23\%) and 20:5n-3 (11 to 13\%). The flagellate-derived fatty acids, 18:4n-3 (3 to 6\%) and 22:6n-3 (1 to 3\%), were minor constituents. The fatty acid compositions of the small amounts of polar lipid in the 3 species were indistinguishable with 22:6n-3 (41 to 46\%) and 20:5n-3 (22 to 24\%) being the major components. We conclude that Stage V and females of the species can be distinguished in autumn on the basis of the different \% of 22:1n-11 and 20:1n-9 fatty alcohols in their wax esters and that de novo lipid biosynthetic activity in the copepods increases in the order C. finmarchicus {\textless} C. glacialis {\textless} C. hyperboreus. We discuss the results in terms of the contributions of fatty acids and fatty alcohols biosynthesised de novo and fatty acids derived from the diet to the copepods¹ lipids, the role of 20:1 and 22:1 fatty alcohols and fatty acids as energy sources, and the possible role of 22:6n-3 in the copepods¹ physiology.},

Reference is made to existing data andalgorithms regarding primary production and verticalexport of carbon from the euphotic zone, both onannual and daily time scales. Examples regarding therole of nutrient addition, removal of pelagiccarnivores and zooplankton grazing for vertical fluxare presented. It is speculated how variable grazingimpact of micro- and mesozooplankton, as well asherbivorous, omnivorous and carnivorous feedingstrategies of mesozooplankton could compete withaggregation during phytoplankton blooms and influenceexport fluxes. It is concluded that the transport ofparticulate organic matter to depth not only dependson bottom-up regulation as determined by physicalforcing, but also on the structure and function of theprevailing planktonic food web. Scenarios arepresented which indicate that top-down regulationplays a pivotal role for the regulation of verticalflux. This conclusion may have crucial consequencesfor future biogeochemical programmes investigatingpelagic-benthic coupling in the ocean. The endeavoursof many research programmes are dominated by lines ofthought where straightforward biogeochemistry andbottom-up regulation is the focus. Phyto- andzooplankton as well as process-oriented researchactivities have to be the focal point of futureresearch if the current comprehension of export fromand retention in the upper layers is going to makedistinct progress.},

Production, export and retention of copepod FP were investigated in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) of the northern Barents Sea in July 2003. Older stages of Calanus finmarchicus and C. glacialis dominated the copepod biomass and FP production experiments revealed that more than 90\% of the FP were produced in the upper 50 m where most of the copepods were located both day and night. Copepod pellets typically made up ∼10\% of the vertical particulate organic carbon flux, and significantly less than what was produced by the copepod community. This implies a variable but significant retention of pellets. We suggest that retention of FP is caused partly by the zooplankton themselves and that retention of FP is the rule rather than the exception in the Barents Sea, particularly during non-bloom scenarios.},

In this paper, we described the gene organization, gene rearrangement and codon usage in the mitochondrial genome of Euphausia superba Dana 1852 (sampling from Prydz Bay, PB). The mitochondrial genome of E. superba is more than 15,498 bp in length (partial non-coding region was not determined). Translocation of four tRNAs (trnL ( 1 ), trnL ( 2 ), trnW and trnI) and duplication of one tRNA (trnN) were founded in the mitochondrial genome of E. superba when comparing its genome with the pancrustacean ground pattern. To investigate the phylogenetic relationship within Malacostraca, phylogenetic trees based on currently available malacostracan mitochondrial genomes were built with the maximum likelihood and the Bayesian models. All analyses based on nucleotide and amino acid data strongly support the monophyly of Stomatopoda, Penaeidae, Caridea, and Brachyura, which is consistent with previous research. However, the taxonomic position of Euphausiacea within Malacostraca is unstable. From comparing the mitochondrial genome between E. superba (PB) and E. superba (sampling from Weddell Sea, WS), we found that nad2 gene contains maximal variation with 61 segregating sites, following by nad5 gene which has 12 segregating sites. Thus, nad2 and nad5 genes may be used as potential molecular markers to study the inherit diversity among different E. superba groups, which would be helpful to the exploitation and management of E. superba resources.},

	abstract = {Forage fish play a pivotal role in marine ecosystems and economies worldwide by sustaining many predators and fisheries directly and indirectly. We estimate global forage fish contributions to marine ecosystems through a synthesis of 72 published Ecopath models from around the world. Three distinct contributions of forage fish were examined: (i) the ecological support service of forage fish to predators in marine ecosystems, (ii) the total catch and value of forage fisheries and (iii) the support service of forage fish to the catch and value of other commercially targeted predators. Forage fish use and value varied and exhibited patterns across latitudes and ecosystem types. Forage fish supported many kinds of predators, including fish, seabirds, marine mammals and squid. Overall, forage fish contribute a total of about \$16.9 billion USD to global fisheries values annually, i.e. 20\% of the global ex-vessel catch values of all marine fisheries combined. While the global catch value of forage fisheries was \$5.6 billion, fisheries supported by forage fish were more than twice as valuable (\$11.3 billion). These estimates provide important information for evaluating the trade-offs of various uses of forage fish across ecosystem types, latitudes and globally. We did not estimate a monetary value for supportive contributions of forage fish to recreational fisheries or to uses unrelated to fisheries, and thus the estimates of economic value reported herein understate the global value of forage fishes.},

Here we have performed a comparative, functional analysis of the circadian clock involving the zebrafish that is normally exposed to the day-night cycle and a cavefish species that has evolved in perpetual darkness. Our results reveal that the cavefish retains a food-entrainable clock that oscillates with an infradian period. Importantly, however, this clock is not regulated by light. This comparative study pinpoints the two extra-retinal photoreceptors Melanopsin (Opn4m2) and TMT-opsin as essential upstream elements of the peripheral clock light input pathway},

	abstract = {The present paper describes the composition, abundance, biomass and diversity of the meso- and macrozooplankton in the epipelagic zone of the open water and under the ice of the northern Weddell Sea. Samples were collected in October/November 1988 with a multiple RMT1+8 net during the European Polarstern Study (EPOS). Multivariate analysis resulted in two distinct site clusters, a northern one mainly located in the open water/marginal ice zone and a southern one extending from the marginal ice zone into the Consolidated pack-ice. Clusters were, however, faunistically coherent with a high degree in positive covariation of species. There was no basis for the separation into communities, but differences occurred on the population level in numerical abundances, biomass (wet weight) and in a shift in species dominance. Different ice zones and vertical layers were tested among each other with regard to their relative species abundance. Significant differences were found between the upper 60 m layer of the open sea, the upper 60 m layer of the closed pack-ice and the so called transitional zone. Species richness and diversity was lowest directly under the closed pack-ice. Abundance and biomass was highest in the surface layer of the open water, while both variables decreased dramatically under the ice. Copepods dominated numerically in open water, while salps dominated in biomass. Euphausia superba and Thysanoessa macrura were the dominant species in the upper water column of the closed pack-ice zone. Krill was the only species with increasing abundance in the sub-ice area and a dominance in biomass of more than 91\% demonstrated its unique importance for the sub-ice habitat.},

	abstract = {Biosynthesis of lipids by Thysanoessa inermis collected from Balsfjorden, northern Norway, in May 1980, was examined in vitro. The highest concentration of lipid within the krill was in the “hepatopancreas”, and this organ was the most active in esterifying free fatty acids into wax esters. The “hepatopancreas” (i.e., thoracic contents) incorporated (14C) glucose, (14C) alanine and 3H2O into wax esters, with the fatty alcohol moieties being labelled more than the fatty acids. (14C) fatty acid was incorporated preferentially into the fatty acid moieties of wax esters, this incorporation being markedly stimulated by free fatty alcohol. It is concluded that the fatty alcohols of wax esters are preferentially biosynthesized de novo from dietary protein and carbohydrates, whereas the fatty acids derive preferentially from dietary lipid. On the basis of 3H incorporated from 3H2O, the hepatopancreas in a 50 mg II-group (2 yr old) individual of T. inermis is capable of biosynthesizing de novo, approximately 0.1 mg of lipid (as fatty acids) per day at 5°C.},

The model was constructed from a combination of parameterised functions and empirical field data obtained during summer conditions. Parameter matrices were set up to cover the entire water column over a 24-h period. The first matrix contained values for "net energy gain," which incorporated empirical data on temperature-dependent respiration, copepod and phytoplankton abundance, and a functional response model for feeding rate. The second matrix expressed the risk of encountering a generalised visual (fish) predator as a function of light levels.

	abstract = {The effect of different light regimes on physiological parameters (feeding activity, oxygen consumption, and activity of the metabolic enzyme malate dehydrogenase [MDH]) of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, was studied over 12 weeks under laboratory conditions. Krill were exposed to light-cycle regimes of variable intensity to simulate Southern Ocean summer, autumn, and winter conditions, respectively, using: (1) continuous light (LL; 200 lux max), (2) 12-h light and 12-h darkness (LD 12 : 12; 50 lux max), and (3) continuous darkness (DD). In all experimental groups, the food concentration was kept at high levels (similar to 800 mu g C L-1). Krill exposed to LL and LD 12 : 12 showed an increase in all measured parameters over the experimental period. Physiological parameters of krill held under LD 12 : 12 showed a more consistent increase and remained below those of krill held under LL. No change was recorded for krill exposed to DD; clearance rates and daily C rations did not respond to the high food availability, and oxygen consumption rates and MDH activity were significantly lower (p {\textless} 0.05) than those of krill exposed to summer light condition. Thus, changes in the environmental light regime have an important effect on physiological parameters of krill, such as feeding and metabolic rates, and may indicate an inherent overwinter adaptation strategy triggered by the Antarctic light regime.},

	abstract = {The Antarctic icefishes (Family Channichthyidae) provide excellent examples of unique traits that can arise in a chronically cold and isolated environment. Their loss of hemoglobin (Hb) expression, and in some cases, loss of myoglobin (Mb) expression, has taught us much about the function of these proteins. Although absences of the proteins are fixed traits in icefishes, the losses do not appear to be of adaptive value. Contrary to some suggestions, loss of Hb has led to higher energetic costs for circulating blood, and losses of Mb have reduced cardiac performance. Moreover, losses of Hb and Mb have resulted in extensive modifications to the cardiovascular system to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to working muscles. Recent studies suggest that losses of Hb and Mb, and their associated nitric oxide (NO)-oxygenase activities, may have accelerated the development and evolution of these cardiovascular modifications. The high levels of NO that should occur in the absence of Hb and Mb have been shown in other animal groups to lead to an increase in tissue vascularization, an increase in the lumenal diameter of blood vessels, and an increase in mitochondrial densities. These characteristics are all hallmark traits of Antarctic icefishes. Homeostatic feedback mechanisms thus may have accelerated evolution of the pronounced cardiovascular traits of Antarctic icefishes.},

Possible biotransformations of fatty acids in the food chain were examined in mixed zoo- plankton and krill faecal material from the Ligurian Sea and Kattegat. The Ligurian Sea population was distinguished from the Kattegat and Clyde Sea populations in terms of both TG and PL fatty acid profiles. The Kattegat and Clyde Sea populations were separated from each other in terms of their PL fatty acid profiles only. Krill sampled in winter from all sites had significantly higher levels of 20:1 and 22:1 fatty acids in the TG fraction (917\%) than krill sampled in summer (110\%). These fatty acids in particular indicate carnivorous dietary input, as they are found in high levels in copepods, which are the major prey species of M. norvegica. Levels of 22:6(n3) were significantly higher than 20:5(n3) in Ligurian krill, which, together with other specific marker fatty acids, suggested a predominance of dinoflagellates and other nondiatom species in their diet. TG fatty acids in Kattegat and Clyde Sea krill indicate a pre- dominance of diatoms in the diet.},

	abstract = {Copepodite stages V and females of four dominant Antarctic species of calanoid copepods were collected during various expeditions to the eastern Weddell Sea in mid-winter, late winter to early spring, summer and autumn. Analyses of total lipid content and sexual maturity showed some general similarities between species concerning the seasonal cycle of energy reserves and gonad maturation, but also revealed important interspecific differences in the life histories of these copepods. Calanus propinquus and Metridia gerlachei exhibited a seasonal lipid pattern with maxima in autumn and lipid minima during spring. Lipid decrease in the females usually coincided with gonad maturation, which proceeded well before the onset of phytoplankton production. This basic pattern was not as clearly discernible in the females of Calanoides acutus and Rhincalanus gigas. In the Weddell Sea, C. propinquus and C. acutus reached much higher lipid levels and seemed to rely more on internal energy depots than did M. gerlachei and R. gigas. The specific timing of reproduction in the Weddell Sea also differed among the species. M. gerlachei had the longest reproductive period, probably extending from September to March, followed by C. propinquus (October–February) and C. acutus (November–March). In contrast, R. gigas seemed to reproduce only from late December to February in the eastern Weddell Sea. Our findings emphasize the importance of lipid reserves for fueling reproductive processes before the spring phytoplankton bloom becomes available. Only a smaller portion of the accumulated energy stores appears to be utilized for metabolic maintenance during the food-limited winter period.},

	abstract = {In this article, we review evidence of how climate change has already resulted in clearly discernable changes in marine Arctic ecosystems. After defining the term ‘footprint’ and evaluating the availability of reliable baseline information we review the published literature to synthesize the footprints of climate change impacts in marine Arctic ecosystems reported as of mid-2009. We found a total of 51 reports of documented changes in Arctic marine biota in response to climate change. Among the responses evaluated were range shifts and changes in abundance, growth/condition, behaviour/phenology and community/regime shifts. Most reports concerned marine mammals, particularly polar bears, and fish. The number of well-documented changes in planktonic and benthic systems was surprisingly low. Evident losses of endemic species in the Arctic Ocean, and in ice algae production and associated community remained difficult to evaluate due to the lack of quantitative reports of its abundance and distribution. Very few footprints of climate change were reported in the literature from regions such as the wide Siberian shelf and the central Arctic Ocean due to the limited research effort made in these ecosystems. Despite the alarming nature of warming and its strong potential effects in the Arctic Ocean the research effort evaluating the impacts of climate change in this region is rather limited.},

Climate change may have unexpected consequences because different species show unique responses to changes in environmental temperatures.

The timing of thermal stratification and the spring diatom bloom have advanced by more than 20 days during this time period. A long-term decline in Daphnia populations, the keystone herbivore, is associated with an expanding temporal mismatch with the spring diatom bloom and may have severe consequences for resource flow to upper trophic levels.},

They are the structures where the circadian periodicity is expressed (effectors) and which transform information from external light signals to be conducted to the pacemaker in order to induce adjustments of the rhythm (synchronizers). After isolation, eyestalks perfused in a pigment dispersing hormone (PDH) solution, show significant changes in receptor potential (RP) amplitude and duration. Exogenous PDH injected into intact crayfish induces a migration of retinal shielding pigments to a light-adapted state. A single dose of PDH produces advances or delays in the circadian rhythm of response to light of visual photoreceptors. All these effects depend on the circadian phase of PDH application. Consequently, the determination of the action of exogenous PDH on photoreceptor cells proved to be very helpful in understanding some mechanisms underlying the circadian organization of crayfish.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Polar environments are characterized by extreme seasonal changes in day length, light intensity and spectrum, the extent of sea ice during the winter, and food availability. A key species of the Southern Ocean ecosystem, the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) has evolved rhythmic physiological and behavioral mechanisms to adapt to daily and seasonal changes. The molecular organization of the clockwork underlying these biological rhythms is, nevertheless, still only partially understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The genome sequence of the Antarctic krill is not yet available. A normalized cDNA library was produced and pyrosequenced in the attempt to identify large numbers of transcripts. All available E. superba sequences were then assembled to create the most complete existing oligonucleotide microarray platform with a total of 32,217 probes. Gene expression signatures of specimens collected in the Ross Sea at five different time points over a 24-hour cycle were defined, and 1,308 genes differentially expressed were identified. Of the corresponding transcripts, 609 showed a significant sinusoidal expression pattern; about 40\% of these exibithed a 24-hour periodicity while the other 60\% was characterized by a shorter (about 12-hour) rhythm. We assigned the differentially expressed genes to functional categories and noticed that those concerning translation, proteolysis, energy and metabolic process, redox regulation, visual transduction and stress response, which are most likely related to daily environmental changes, were significantly enriched. Two transcripts of peroxiredoxin, thought to represent the ancestral timekeeping system that evolved about 2.5 billion years ago, were also identified as were two isoforms of the EsRh1 opsin and two novel arrestin1 sequences involved in the visual transduction cascade. CONCLUSIONS: Our work represents the first characterization of the krill diurnal transcriptome under natural conditions and provides a first insight into the genetic regulation of physiological changes, which occur around the clock during an Antarctic summer day},

- specimens from the Ross Sea- developing and sequencing a normalized cDNA library from krill specimens sampled at 5 different times of the day across a complete 24-day cycle- first krill oligo DNA microarray platform (Krill 1.1)- RNA was extracted from the head (including brain and compound eyes)
 
Finding
- 8\% of probe differentially expressed during the 24 hours cycle- 35\% of the consensus sequence were annotated- other 65\% showed no or poor similarity matches and represent completely unknown krill transcripts- 609 out of the 1,308 differentially expressed genes showed sinusoidal expression patterns (significant)- confirmation of previous findings concerning daily fluctuations in abundance for Escry mRNA in the head
 
Peptide synthesis and processing
- 47 transcirpts, 32 with a peak expression at 6h- protein synthesis AND degradation have to be regulated to maintain diurnal oscillation of protein expression
 
Transcription
- identification of two circadianly regulated chromatin-remodelling enzymes
 
Energetic and metabolic processes
- proteins involved in glycolysis and oxidative metabolism, component of ATP synthase and mitochondrial complexes, citrate synthase (expression with peak at 06:00 h)- over-expression at 10:00h: transcript for ATP citrate lyase and Acetyl-CoA carboxilase --{\textgreater} related to activation of the fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthetic pathways- peak from late afternoon throughout the night: genes involved in glycogen breakdown, gluconeogenesis, fatty acid-ß-oxidation (glycogen debranching enzymes, fructose-1,6-bisphospatase, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) --{\textgreater} sinusoidal oscillation not for all confirmed by CircWaveBatch- transcripts for three key enzymes (ATP citrate lyase, Acetyl-CoA carboxylase, Acetyl-CoA Acetly transferase) in fatty acid metabolism --{\textgreater} sinusoidal oscillation- 29 of 41 transcripts involved in glucose oxidative pathways (major energy source in neurons)
 
Redox regulation
- 12 genes- significant bimodal oscillation (5 and 17h): ferritin 1, ferritin light chain, heme binding protein 2- iron metabolism could be modulated by a circadian clock in krill
 
Transport and signal transduction
- 69 out of 336 genes- genes involved in vesicle trafficking- gene for AP-1 complex subunit sigma 2 (protein sorting in trans GNW) --{\textgreater} bimodal sinusoidal oscillation with peaks at 6 and 18 h- gene for synaptoporin (intrinsic membrane protein in small synaptic vesicles) --{\textgreater} sinusoidal expression pattern with peak expression at 04:00- several oscillatory transcirpts in metabolism of glutamate- glutamine synthetase and glutamate dehydrogenase expression peak at 24:00 and 06:00- GMP synthase/glutamine amidotransferase --{\textgreater} sinusoidal expression pattern + 12 hours periodicity- PDF receptor differentially expressed with peak at 06:00- genes linked to visual system --{\textgreater} peak at 06:00
 
CONCLUSION
- first krill oligonucleotide microarray platform --{\textgreater} to investiagte its genomic expression- first diurnal transcriptome characterization of krill obtained in natural conditions on a summer day in the Antarctica- 1,300 genes differentially expressed across time points- many showed cyclic  sinuscoidal expression- different peak exprssion for different functional categories confine specific biological processes to particular times
--{\textgreater} chronological progession of biochemical and physiological events throughout the 24-hour cycle most likely reflects the workings of an endogenous circadian clock that controls krill metabolism},

	abstract = {Zooplankton community structure and trophic ecology were investigated in the marginal ice zone of the Southern Scotia Sea during the austral winter of 1988 as part of the AMERIEZ program. In the study area, near the South Orkneys (34–49°W, 57–61.5°S), water emerging from the Weddell Sea mixed with Scotia Sea water to form a complex field of mesoscale eddies and meanders. Three primary zooplankton communities were identified: a shallow cold water assemblage typical of Weddell Sea water; a shallow/upper mesopelagic assemblage of subantarctic species introduced into the southern Scotia Sea with warm core eddies from the Polar Front; and a deep (\&gt;400 m) mesopelagic community with circumtantartic species. Zooplankton numerical dominants were cyclopoid copepods (mostly Oithona spp.); biomass dominants were four calanoid copepods, Calanoides acutus, Rhincalanus gigas, Calanus propinquus and Metridia gerlachei. Calanoides acutus and R. gigas were undergoing winter diapause in the mesopelagic zone (\&gt;400 m) whereas M. gerlachei and C. propinquus were distributed throughout the water column. In the subantarctic eddies M. gerlachei was replaced by M. lucens as a dominant and R. gigas was more abundant than in cold water to the south.

Diet analysis of 35 dominant species revealed five feeding guilds among the zooplankton. One consisted primarily of small herbivorous copepods. Two closely related guilds consisting of copepods, krill and salps were omnivorous, feeding on phytoplankton, protozoans, metazoans and crustacean debris (molts). Two guilds were constituted by predatory copepods and chaetognaths. A sixth group, all copepods, which included important numerical and biomass dominants of the region, was trophically inactive. A comparison of gut fullness between winter 1988 and fall 1986 revealed that all but two of 19 small particle grazing species had significantly less food in their guts in winter. The exceptions were the biomass dominants C. propinquus and M. gerlachei, which were actively feeding in winter. Phytoplankton biomass was low in winter, averaging two-thirds that in fall.

Several major trophic pathways from phytoplankton through apex predators (birds and mammals) are proposed for winter in the southern Scotia Sea with zooplankton playing a central role in each.},

	title = {South {Georgia}, {Antarctica}: a productive, cold water, pelagic ecosystem},
	volume = {216},
	abstract = {The South Georgia region is characterised by high biomass and productivity of phyto-plankton, zooplankton and vertebrate predators. Important commercial fisheries have been based at the island since the late 1700s, initially exploiting seals and whales, and currently taking krill Euphausia superbaand finfish. Despite studies dating from the beginning of the last century, the causes of the high productivity remain unclear. The island lies within the Antarctic Zone of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, to the south of the Polar Front. The offshore waters to its north and east are affected by a north-wards deflection of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front, together with waters from the Weddell-Scotia Confluence. Despite a retentive circulation over the shelf, the high productivity of phyto-plankton and copepods is widespread, occurring far downstream and possibly extending to the Polar Front. High phytoplankton concentrations ({\textgreater}20 mg chlorophyll a m-3) may be linked to enhanced supply of iron or reduced forms of nitrogen (up to 3 mmol ammonium m-3). Although macronutrients are gen-erally not limiting in the Antarctic Zone, silicate concentrationsof {\textless}1 mmol m-3are growth-limiting at South Georgia in some summers. The growth season is long and blooms of {\textgreater}2 mg chlam-3occur for 4to5 mo. Biomass of krill plus net-caught zooplankton in summer is around 15 to 20 g dry mass m-2, equally dominated by krill and copepods. This greatly exceeds typical values for Antarctica, and is high compared to productive northern shelves. Zooplankton, and in particular krill, appear to have a pivotal role in regulating energy flow in this food web, through selective grazing and possibly also through nutrient regeneration. Abundances of krill and copepods are negatively related across a wide range of scales, suggesting direct interaction through competition or predation. Evidence suggests that when phytoplankton stocks are low, energy flow through krill is maintained by their feeding on the large pop-ulations of small copepods. Metazoans and higher predators at South Georgia can feed across several trophic levels according to prey abundance, and they regenerate substantial quantities of reduced nitrogen. Therefore we suggest that these groups have a controlling influence on lower trophic levels, both stabilising population sizes and maintaining high rates of energy flow. Hydrography, nutrient con-centrations, phytoplankton, copepod, and krill biomasses fluctuate between years. Periodically (once or twice a decade), shortages of krill in summer result in breeding failures among many of their predators. This appears to be a downstream effect from wider scale, Scotia Sea phenomena, although the processes involved are unclear. The elevated biomass and energy flows at South Georgia appear to be caused by locally enhanced growth rates; there is no evidence so far for any physical concentration mechanism. Even for krill, which do not breed there, local growth rates are probably of a similar order to the biomass removed by their main land-based predators in summer. Thus the transfer of energy to higher predators depends on local enhancement of fluxes through the food web as well as thesupply of plankton to the island by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2164-11-582},
	abstract = {Background: All crustaceans periodically moult to renew their exoskeleton. In krill this involves partial digestion and resorption of the old exoskeleton and synthesis of new cuticle. Molecular events that underlie the moult cycle are poorly understood in calcifying crustaceans and even less so in non-calcifying organisms such as krill. To address this we constructed an Antarctic krill cDNA microarray in order to generate gene expression profiles across the moult cycle and identify possible activation pathways. Results: A total of 26 different cuticle genes were identified that showed differential gene expression across the moult cycle. Almost all cuticle genes were up regulated during premoult and down regulated during late intermoult. There were a number of transcripts with significant sequence homology to genes potentially involved in the synthesis, breakdown and resorption of chitin. During early premoult glutamine synthetase, a gene involved in generating an amino acid used in the synthesis of glucosamine, a constituent of chitin, was up regulated more than twofold. Mannosyltransferase 1, a member of the glycosyltransferase family of enzymes that includes chitin synthase was also up regulated during early premoult. Transcripts homologous to a b-N-acetylglucosaminidase (b-NAGase) precursor were expressed at a higher level during late intermoult (prior to apolysis) than during premoult. This observation coincided with the up regulation during late intermoult, of a coatomer subunit epsilon involved in the production of vesicles that maybe used to transport the b-NAGase precursors into the exuvial cleft. Trypsin, known to activate the b-NAGase precursor, was up regulated more than fourfold during premoult. The up regulation of a predicted oligopeptide transporter during premoult may allow the transport of chitin breakdown products across the newly synthesised epi- and exocuticle layers. Conclusion: We have identified many genes differentially expressed across the moult cycle of krill that correspond with known phenotypic structural changes. This study has provided a better understanding of the processes involved in krill moulting and how they may be controlled at the gene expression level.},

Importance of Krill
- Euphausiaceae: world wirde distribution, 86 species- size range: few mm to 15 cm body length- Antacrtic krill exclusively found in SO, up to 6.5 cm- Krill: 200 to 500 mio tonnes wet mass- importance for commercial fishing and large numbers of higher predators
 
Crustacean moulting
- for moulting: loss of connection between living tissue and exracellular cuticle- process only a few minutes, but built up of new skeleton takes much longer (dramatic changes in physiology and biochemistry)
 
Krill moulting
- continues thourghout adult life at relatively high frequency- capacity to shrink or grow at each moult- frequent moulting could allow individuals to adjust body size according to prevailing conditions- regular moulting --{\textgreater} less opportunities for bacteria to settle  and penetrate- high energy cost for moulting --{\textgreater} under strong selective pressure
 
Krill cuticle and moult cycle
- cuticle = complex structure composed mainly of alpha-chitin microfibrils embedden in a protein matrix- laminae- three different layers: epicuticle (outermost), exocuticle, endocuticle- epicuticle: only layer containing glycoproteins in addition ti chitin/protein matrix, but contributes only 1.6\% to total cuticular thickness- exocuticle: makes up 20\% of cuticle- epi and exocuticle dpeosited before krill sheds its old shell in the moult- endocuticle: remainder, quickly built up in the postmoult period- epidermis: beneath these layers, forming of new cuticle and secreting enzymes for digestion
 
Stages of moulting
• Postmoult (Stages A and B) - a soft cuticle• Intermoult (Stage C) - a consolidated and har- dened cuticle• Early Premoult (Stages D0 to D2) - exuvial cleft between the old cuticle and the epidermis, followed by the progressive development of an underlying new cuticle• Late premoult (Stage D3) - old cuticle is soft• Ecdysis - the old cuticle detaches from the body
- enyzmes digesting old cuticle: beta-NAGase and chitinase (peak expression in premoult)
 
Conflict between cuticle formation and resorption
- digesting old cuticle withhout digesting new one- physical separation of enzymes through cuticular barriers- encloscure of enyzmes in vesicle and release in appropriate environements
 
Aims of the study
- identification of genes involved or associated with the formation and recycling of cuticle in krill and study their expression patterns throughout the moult cycle
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
 
Microarray analysis
- eight cluster groups that were each dominated by a particulat moult stage
 
Cuticle genes
- krill are almost unique among curstaceans in that they do not have a calcified exoskeleton --{\textgreater} supported by the types of cuticle genes found differentially expressed- glutamine synthetase involved with cuticle synthesis: upregulated in this stage, enzymes which is involved in the synthesis of glutamine- glutamine, along with fructose 6-phosphate, used in synthesis of glucosamine (=polymers making up chitin)

Antarctic krill are a key component of the diet of Adélie penguins inhabiting the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), yet our understanding of the variability of krill distribution patterns within nearshore penguin feeding grounds is limited. A recent study of the foraging patterns of penguins breeding in the northern WAP suggests that tidal phase plays a role in foraging distance. We used acoustics to examine biomass and aggregation structure of krill in the penguin foraging grounds off Palmer Station during diurnal and semi-diurnal tides. Nearshore, integrated krill biomass during diurnal tides was significantly higher than during semi-diurnal tides. Krill aggregations were also shallower, closer together, and larger in dimension during diurnal tides. Conversely, krill aggregations had higher volumetric biomass and abundance during semi-diurnal tides. Further offshore, at the head of the Palmer Deep canyon, krill aggregations were similar to those observed nearshore during diurnal tides (i.e. shallow, close together, and large in dimension). Since krill aggregation structure strongly influences availability as a potential prey source, we suggest that foraging behavior of Adélie penguins in this region is strongly linked to the variability in nearshore krill aggregation structure as well as biomass.},

The high gene count is a consequence of an elevated rate of gene duplication resulting in tandem gene clusters. More than a third of Daphnia's genes have no detectable homologs in any other available proteome, and the most amplified gene families are specific to the Daphnia lineage. The coexpansion of gene families interacting within metabolic pathways suggests that the maintenance of duplicated genes is not random, and the analysis of gene expression under different environmental conditions reveals that numerous paralogs acquire divergent expression patterns soon after duplication. Daphnia-specific genes, including many additional loci within sequenced regions that are otherwise devoid of annotations, are the most responsive genes to ecological challenges},

Retrospective data not only help to clarify underlying causes and rates of ecological change, but they also demonstrate achievable goals for restoration and management of coastal ecosystems that could not even be contemplated based on the limited perspective of recent observations alone.},

	abstract = {Four major functional units have been identified in the Southern Ocean and the mechanisms that control the dynamics of nutrients and phytoplankton are detailed for the different sub-systems. The very productive Coastal and Continental Shelf Zone (CCSZ, 0.9 M km 2) can experience severe macronutrient depletion paralleling intense diatom-dominated phytoplankton blooming (maximum {\textgreater} 8 mg Chl a m−3) at the ice edge. In the Seasonal Ice Zone (SIZ, 16 M km 2), dramatic variations in the hydrological structure occur in surface waters during the spring to summer retreat of the pack-ice, changing from a well-mixed system to a stratified one within the reaches of the ice edge. Grazing activity of euphausiids limits phytoplankton biomass to a moderate level (Chl a maximum around 4 mg m−3). A shift from new production to a regenerated production regime has been demonstrated during spring, along with the key role played by protozoans in controlling high ammonium concentrations (maximum {\textgreater} 2 μM) in the surface layers. The well-mixed Permanently Open Ocean Zone (POOZ, 14 M km 2) is characterised by variable N/Si ratios in surface waters along a north-south transect: at the northern border of the POOZ (N/Si = 0.25) silicate concentrations as low as {\textless} 10 μM could help limit the phytoplankton growth. Although favourable conditions have been demonstrated for the initiation of blooms in spring in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, it appears that critical-depth/ mixing-depth relationships control maximum chlorophyll a concentrations {\textless} 1 μg l−1 during summer. The POOZ is usually not influenced directly by euphausiids, except for the Scotia Sea and Drake Passage where migrations of krill from the adjacent SIZ are usual. Mesoscale eddies are typical of the Polar Front Zone (FPZ, 3 M km 2): significant increases in phytoplankton biomass have been reported in this frontal area (maximum Chl a = 2 mg m−3). Food web and biogeochemical cycles in this sub-system are poorly documented. The question of limitation of the primary production by eolian-transported trace-metals in these different sub-systems is still a matter of debate, although clear iron limitation has been evidenced for offshore waters of the Ross Sea.},

Effects of climatological and oceanographic variables, such as temperature, sea ice, turbulence, and advection, on marine organisms are discussed in terms of their influence on growth, distribution, reproduction, activity rates, recruitment and mortality. Organisms tend to be limited to specific thermal ranges with experimental findings showing that sufficient oxygen supply by ventilation and circulation only occurs within these ranges. Indirect effects of climate forcing through effects on the food web are also discussed. Research and data needs required to improve our knowledge of the processes linking climate to ecosystem changes are presented along with our assessment of our ability to predict ecosystem responses to future climate change scenarios.},

	abstract = {The Southern Ocean is known to have warmed considerably during the second half of the 20th century but there are few locations with data before the 1950s. In addition, assessments of change in this region are hampered by the strong seasonal bias in sampling, with the vast majority of data collected during the austral summer. However, oceanographic measurements near South Georgia span most of the last century, and we here consider almost year-round data from this location over an 81-year period (19252006). We observe significant warming between the early and late 20th century, with differential warming between summer and winter months and an indication that late 20th century summer temperatures peaked 6 days earlier. To quantify the long-term warming trend in this highly variable data, a mixed model utilising a Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) method was used. Over the 81-year period, a mean increase of 0.9\&\#xa0;$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C in January and 2.3\&\#xa0;$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C in August was evident in the top 100\&\#xa0;m of the water column. Warming diminished below 100\&\#xa0;m and approached 0 at 200\&\#xa0;m. Thus the long-term warming around South Georgia is substantialmore so than documented previously for the circumpolar warming of the Southern Ocean. We examine potential causal effects of this trend, including local atmospheric and cryospheric change, the influence of upstream waters and the role of coupled modes of climate variability such as El Niño/Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). It is likely that all of these play a part in the observed temperature increase. However, the role of the \{SAM\} is strongly indicated, via its likely role in the circumpolar warming trend in the Southern Ocean, and also by the atypical response of the South Georgia region to changes in heat fluxes associated with the SAM. Furthermore, the combination of a regional decline in ice extent and strong upstream warming likely explains a significant part of the strong seasonal variation apparent in the warming trend. In addition, we consider the implications that long-term warming has for South Georgia's lower trophic levels. For Euphausia superba, at their northern limit, we find a significant negative relationship between summer South Georgia water temperatures and mean summer density of E. superba across the southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Simple abundance and growth rate relationships with our long-term temperature data appear to show declining habitat suitability for E. superba. In contrast, the warming trend is likely to favour other macro- and mesozooplankton species that occupy the more northerly parts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and it is likely to promote phytoplankton growth.},

	abstract = {The freshwater cnidarian Hydra was first described in 1702 and has been the object of study for 300 years. Experimental studies of Hydra between 1736 and 1744 culminated in the discovery of asexual reproduction of an animal by budding, the first description of regeneration in an animal, and successful transplantation of tissue between animals. Today, Hydra is an important model for studies of axial patterning, stem cell biology and regeneration. Here we report the genome of Hydra magnipapillata and compare it to the genomes of the anthozoan Nematostella vectensis and other animals. The Hydra genome has been shaped by bursts of transposable element expansion, horizontal gene transfer, trans-splicing, and simplification of gene structure and gene content that parallel simplification of the Hydra life cycle. We also report the sequence of the genome of a novel bacterium stably associated with H. magnipapillata. Comparisons of the Hydra genome to the genomes of other animals shed light on the evolution of epithelia, contractile tissues, developmentally regulated transcription factors, the Spemann–Mangold organizer, pluripotency genes and the neuromuscular junction.},

	abstract = {Understanding the origin and maintenance of genetic diversity in the oceanic realm is difficult because barriers to gene flow are far less obvious in marine compared to terrestrial species. This is particularly so for planktonic species such as euphausiids, with no fossil record and high rates of dispersal, and in which paleobiology and evolutionary history remains largely obscure. Population genetics may play an important role in this respect, elucidating population connectivity and shedding light on the historical demography of the investigated species. In turn, the relevant factors that can promote speciation over both at short and long evolutionary timescales can be identified. In this chapter, we outline the available approaches for gathering population genetics information on marine organisms, with a particular focus on the recent achievements in the study of Meganyctiphanes norvegica. For population structure, we review the data available for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers that show the presence of four temporally stable and genetically distinct gene pools, one in the Mediterranean samples and three others in the North Atlantic Ocean, potentially associated with the basin-scale pattern of circulation. Unpublished data on some nuclear microsatellite markers adds support to this conclusion. In addition, we apply a newly introduced Bayesian coalescent approach, and demonstrate that previously reported mitochondrial sequence diversity is indicative of a recent expansion at the Northern edge of the species' distribution. This does not hold for the Southern and Mediterranean populations that appear to be stable over time. We also review the literature reporting new advances on the analysis of M. norvegica genes and genes' products involved in metabolic pathways that may underline differences at the population level, possibly linked to environmental variation and local adaptations.},

	abstract = {The present study addresses the effect of maternal diet on hatching success and condition of embryos and larvae of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. Lipid and fatty acid content and composition were determined in field and laboratory samples. Developmental stages analyzed in embryos included: multiple-cell, gastrula, and limb-bud stages. Larval stages analyzed included: nauplius I, nauplius II, and metanauplius. Laboratory-reared embryos were spawned by gravid females incubated under three feeding groups: (1) phytoplankton mixture, (2) phytoplankton mixture and minced clam, and (3) phytoplankton mixture, minced clam, and commercial larval food. Hatching success was highest in group 3 (100\%), lowest in group 1 (0\%), and highly variable in field samples (0–48\%). Lipid decreased slightly in embryos during embryonic development, while large decreases in lipid were found during nauplius development. High levels of 18:2(n-6), 20:4(n-6), and 22:6(n-3) observed with group 3 samples coincided with high hatching success in krill embryos. The ratio of 22:6(n-3)/20:5(n-3) also correlated to hatching success of embryos. The fatty acid profile of embryos in group 3 was similar to that of the field-collected embryos, reflecting the contribution of the commercial larval food in the maternal diet. In our study, the maternal diet was found to influence the fatty acid composition of embryos and in turn affects the hatching success of krill. Specific polyunsaturated fatty acids appeared to play important roles in embryogenesis in krill.},

	abstract = {A quantitative characterization of growth-related parameters for larval and juvenile Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba (Dana), is essential to understanding the early life history of this key species in the Southern Ocean ecosystem. To this end, instantaneous growth rate experiments were conducted with larval and juvenile krill to determine growth increments and molting frequency in situ. All experiments were carried out during fall and winter months (April through September) on nine separate cruises west of the Antarctic Peninsula between 1987 and 1999. A consistent seasonal pattern across years was observed: growth rates decreased during fall (April/May), were minimal in early winter (June), and increased to maximum rates by late winter (September). Habitat-specific differences (water column vs under-ice) in growth rates of larvae collected on the same cruise were not observed in early winter (June 1993; within-year comparison). However, in a between-year comparison, larvae from the under-ice habitat (June/July 1987) had significantly higher growth increments than larvae from the open-water habitat (July 1989). The difference between these two comparisons may be a function of the degree of contrast in food availability in the water column and the sea ice at different times in the winter. Daylength at the time of collection explained 74\% of the variation in larval and juvenile growth rates. This correlation may be an indirect effect of the influence of diel cycles on krill behavior and/or primary production in both the water column and ice.},

According to some of these models, the photoperiodic clock is based on a mechanism separate from the circadian system, that is, a so-called “hourglass.” According to other models, the clock is based on one or more circadian oscillators that may be coupled to each other and that may or may not show a certain degree of damping. In this context, a rapidly damping oscillator could be regarded as an hourglass. The present article gives an overview of the many different clock models and their philosophies, and it makes comparisons among them to provide a better understanding about how these models are related, if at all, and why the double circadian oscillator model is the most favored model at present.},

	abstract = {Antarctic notothenioids radiated over millions of years in subzero waters, evolving peculiar features, such as antifreeze glycoproteins and absence of heat shock response. Icefish, family Channichthyidae, also lack oxygen-binding proteins and display extreme modifications, including high mitochondrial densities in aerobic tissues. A genomic expansion accompanying the evolution of these fish was reported, but paucity of genomic information limits the understanding of notothenioid cold adaptation. We reconstructed and annotated the first skeletal muscle transcriptome of the icefish Chionodraco hamatus providing a new resource for icefish genomics (http://compgen.bio.unipd.it/chamatusbase/, last accessed December 12, 2012). We exploited deep sequencing of this energy-dependent tissue to test the hypothesis of selective duplication of genes involved in mitochondrial function. We developed a bioinformatic approach to univocally assign C. hamatus transcripts to orthology groups extracted from phylogenetic trees of five model species. Chionodraco hamatus duplicates were recorded for each orthology group allowing the identification of duplicated genes specific to the icefish lineage. Significantly more duplicates were found in the icefish when transcriptome data were compared with whole-genome data of model species. Indeed, duplicated genes were significantly enriched in proteins with mitochondrial localization, involved in mitochondrial function and biogenesis. In cold conditions and without oxygen-carrying proteins, energy production is challenging. The combination of high mitochondrial densities and the maintenance of duplicated genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and aerobic respiration might confer a selective advantage by improving oxygen diffusion and energy supply to aerobic tissues. Our results provide new insights into the genomic basis of icefish cold adaptation.},

	abstract = {Feeding by juvenile Antarctic krill Euphausia superba near South Georgia was assessed during the austral summer of 1995/1996. Gut fluorescence results were compared with those from incubations in natural seawater and seawater enriched with phytoplankton and zooplankton. In natural seawater, with typically low food concentrations (median 56 mg C m(-3)) the median ration was 0.68 \% of krill carbon d(-1). Phytoplankton dominated carbon in the natural incubation water but dinoflagellates, ciliates and small calanoid copepods dominated the carbon intake of krill. In both natural and enriched water, maximum clearance rates were on 1 to 3 mm calanoid copepods. Copepods larger than this (e.g. late copepodite stages of Calanoides acutus and Rhincalanus gigas) were cleared more slowly despite dominating the carbon in the enriched incubations. Oithona spp. were cleared more slowly than calanoids of similar size, despite their greater abundance and their similar contributions to available carbon. These trends could reflect detection/escape interactions between krill and copepods. With enriched food, copepods dominated krill diet, krill rations exceeded 10 \% of body carbon d(-1) and rations did not appear to reach a plateau even at food concentrations of similar to 1 g C m(-3). This suggests that krill could feed rapidly during periodic encounters with layers or patches of zooplankton. Gut fluorescence revealed gut passage times of 3.7 to 6.3 h and an algal carbon ration of 0.43 \% d(-1), thus supporting the low algal carbon rations derived from the incubations. Published acoustic values of mean krill biomass north of South Georgia that summer of 8.3 g dry mass m(-2) were combined with their clearance rates to give estimates of krill removing daily 0.2\% of phytoplankton standing stocks, 0.6\% of protozoans and 1.6\% of small calanoid copepods. This impact on copepods is much higher than previous estimates from Antarctic amphipods and chaetognaths. The long generation times of Antarctic copepods mean that krill were potentially important predators of small copepods during our study.},

Triacylglycerols were the major lipid class present, although 16.7\% of the total lipid were wax esters in which phytol was the dominant fatty alcohol. The thoracic contents (“hepatopancreas”) of the krill were capable of biosynthesising lipids in vitro from various labelled substrates. Radioactivity from [1-14C] palmitic acid was incorporated into lipids in the order phospholipids{\textgreater}triacylglycerols{\textgreater}wax esters; the bulk of the radioactivity was present in all cases in the fatty acyl moieties of the lipids. [U-14C] glucose labelled lipids in the order phospholipids{\textgreater}triacylglycerols{\textgreater}free fatty acids{\textgreater} was esters; in the first two lipids the radioactivity was mainly in the glycerol moieties, whereas in was esters it was solely in the fatty acyl moieties. The extent of labelling of these lipids from [U-14C] alanine was less than that from [U-14C] glucose, but the pattern of labelling was generally similar. More than 90\% of the radioactivity incorporated into total lipid from 3H2O was present in free fatty acids from which it was calculated that the “hepatopancreas” of T. raschi can synthesise 2.5 μg of fatty acid per hour at 15°C. This value is approximately three times lower than that previously determined for T. inermis from Balsfjorden, northern Norway. The results are discussed in terms of the sources of the dietary lipids of krill and the role of endogenous biosynthesis in contributing to its lipid reserves.},

	abstract = {The advent of high throughput RNA-seq technology allows deep sampling of the transcriptome, making it possible to characterize both the diversity and the abundance of transcript isoforms. Accurate abundance estimation or transcript quantification of isoforms is critical for downstream differential analysis (e.g., healthy vs. diseased cells) but remains a challenging problem for several reasons. First, while various types of algorithms have been developed for abundance estimation, short reads often do not uniquely identify the transcript isoforms from which they were sampled. As a result, the quantification problem may not be identifiable, i.e., lacks a unique transcript solution even if the read maps uniquely to the reference genome. In this article, we develop a general linear model for transcript quantification that leverages reads spanning multiple splice junctions to ameliorate identifiability. Second, RNA-seq reads sampled from the transcriptome exhibit unknown position-specific and sequence-specific biases. We extend our method to simultaneously learn bias parameters during transcript quantification to improve accuracy. Third, transcript quantification is often provided with a candidate set of isoforms, not all of which are likely to be significantly expressed in a given tissue type or condition. By resolving the linear system with LASSO, our approach can infer an accurate set of dominantly expressed transcripts while existing methods tend to assign positive expression to every candidate isoform. Using simulated RNA-seq datasets, our method demonstrated better quantification accuracy and the inference of dominant set of transcripts than existing methods. The application of our method on real data experimentally demonstrated that transcript quantification is effective for differential analysis of transcriptomes.},

Krill have been maintained in small and large jars, deep rectangular tanks, large round tanks and in flow-through and recycling systems. They have been maintained both on board research vessels and in laboratories, in flowing seawater systems at ambient conditions and in temperature-controlled environmental rooms. A few researchers have transported living krill back to their home laboratories, for example tropical laboratories in Japan (Murano) and Australia (Ikeda), temperate laboratories (Nicol) in Australia, a northern European laboratory in Germany (Marschall) and a sunny maritime laboratory in California (Ross and Quetin). The goals have been varied: short-term experiments to understand in situ physiological rates, long-term experiments to test the effects of manipulations or controlled changes in environmental conditions, and behavioral responses.

	abstract = {Antarctic krill is thought to undergo an annual cycle of biological processes to cope with seasonal changes in their en- vironment. The question of whether, and to what degree, seasonal environmental parameters such as photoperiod, food availability and temperature govern metabolism in krill is not clear. In this long-term laboratory study, respiration rates were determined in krill incubated under simulated natural light cycle or total darkness, subjected to fed or starved con- ditions and on krill kept at different temperatures (1C, 1C and 3C). There was a strong and significant increasing trend of respiration rates with month in all experimental treatments. In August (late winter), the mean respiration rates ranged between 0.22 - 0.35 μL O2 mgDW1hr1 for krill in both simulated seasonal light and complete darkness, and 0.25 - 0.26 μL O2 mgDW1hr1 for both fed and starved krill. Mean maximal respiration rates were recorded in Octo- ber and December for all light and feeding treatments (0.46 - 0.56 μL O2 mgDW1hr1). Mean respiration rates for krill in the temperature treatments ranged between 0.24 - 0.30 μL O2 mgDW1hr1 in September reaching mean maximal rates in November and February (0.60 - 0.71 μL O2 mgDW1hr1). The covariate total length of krill was found to be non-significant and there was generally no significant interaction of experimental treatment with month and only for photoperiod comparison was the treatment main effect significant. The dark treatment gave higher respiration rates, and this needs careful interpretation. Results here suggest that, although light, food availability and temperature significantly affect metabolic rates, overall general seasonal pattern of winter low-summer high in respiration observed through the current experiment seemed to have followed an endogenous seasonal rhythm which had already been adjusted to the annual cycle prior to commencement of the experiment.},

	abstract = {Timing of reproduction in a seasonal cycle is a life history trait with important fitness consequences. Capital breeders produce offspring from stored resources and, by decoupling feeding and reproduction, may bend the constraints caused by seasonality in food or predation. Income breeders, on the other hand, produce offspring from concurrent food intake, with the disadvantage of less flexibility, but with high efficiency and no inventory costs of carrying stores. Here, we assess relative profitability of capital and income breeding in herbivorous zooplankton inhabiting seasonal, high-latitude environments. We apply a state-dependent life history model where reproductive values are used to optimise energy allocation and diapause strategies over the year. Three environmental scenarios were modelled: an early, an intermediate, and a late feeding season. We found that capital breeding was most important in the early season. Capital breeding ranged from 7–9\% of the eggs produced but, because of the high reproductive value of early eggs, capital breeding ranged from 9–30\% when measured in terms of reproductive value. The main benefit of capital breeding was reproduction prior to the feeding season – when the reproductive value of an egg peaked. In addition, capital breeding was also used to increase egg production rates at times of income breeding. For individuals born late in the season the model predicted a two-year cycle instead of the typical annual life cycle. These individuals could then reap the benefits of early reproduction and capital breeding in their second year instead of income breeding late in the first year. We emphasize the importance of evaluating reproductive strategies such as capital and income breeding from a complete life cycle perspective. In particular, knowing the seasonality in offspring fitness is essential to appreciate evolutionary and population-level consequences of capital breeding.},

No difference in growth of krill were observed between the Antarctic Peninsula area and the eastern Weddell Sea. Former opinions that differ are discussed. Seasonal growth was re-analyzed for the species Euphausia triacantha, and a three-year life span proposed. Male Euphausia crystallorophias have a shorter life span than females, while their growth rate is similar. A short description of the life cycle and generation time of each species is given.

Physicochemical properties of the different water types should affect the distribution, biomass and species composition of the phytoplankton assemblages. We examined these features in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) of the northwestern Weddell Sea. Areas with the higher biomass were located in the Weddell Sea MIZ where the surface waters were relatively stable due to the sea-ice melting. In these waters, the colonial stage of Phaeocystis antarctica and micro-sized chain-forming diatoms accounted for 70\% of the total phytoplankton carbon. Waters in the Bransfield Strait region, in contrast, were characterized by a dominance of nanoflagellates, which accounted for 80\% of the total phytoplankton carbon. Our observations support the hypothesis that the species composition of phytoplankton communities is a function of the different water mass, reflecting the physical conditions of the upper water column, particularly its stability.},

In this article I present such a model, based on previous descriptions, observations, and recent data from the scientific literature. This model takes into account a range of findings on krill biology and on the relationships between Antarctic krill and its biotic and abiotic environment. Krill life history is thus viewed as an evolved product of interactions between the species and its environment. The model places particular emphasis on the different forces that act on the larval and adult stages, and on the interaction between krill behavior, systems of ocean currents, and sea ice.},

	abstract = {The circadian clock is a molecular network that translates predictable environmental signals, such as light levels, into organismal responses, including behavior and physiology. Regular oscillations of the molecular components of the clock enable individuals to anticipate regularly fluctuating environmental conditions. Cnidarians play important roles in benthic and pelagic marine environments and also occupy a key evolutionary position as the likely sister group to the bilaterians. Together, these attributes make members of this phylum attractive as models for testing hypotheses on roles for circadian clocks in regulating behavior, physiology, and reproduction as well as those regarding the deep evolutionary conservation of circadian regulatory pathways in animal evolution. Here, we review and synthesize the field of cnidarian circadian biology by discussing the diverse effects of daily light cycles on cnidarians, summarizing the molecular evidence for the conservation of a bilaterian-like circadian clock in anthozoan cnidarians, and presenting new empirical data supporting the presence of a conserved feed-forward loop in the starlet sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis. Furthermore, we discuss critical gaps in our current knowledge about the cnidarian clock, including the functions directly regulated by the clock and the precise molecular interactions that drive the oscillating gene-expression patterns. We conclude that the field of cnidarian circadian biology is moving rapidly toward linking molecular mechanisms with physiology and behavior.},

During the Last Glaciation Maximum, at ca. 18 ka BP, both the Weddell and the Ross Gyres as well as near-coastal circulations probably lost their importance in the maintenance of Antarctic krill populations due to cooling of the water column and development of multi-year sea ice. Within the ACC at that time, some smaller-scale circulations related to islands and seamounts could have played a major role in controlling krill distribution. If, nevertheless. refugia for self-maintained krill populations remained in the near-coastal zone, particularly in the eastern Indian sector, geographical isolation might have caused divergence between the two species of the gregarine Cephaloidophora commonly infesting krill at present.},

A key challenge is to understand how different activities over the year are linked. For instance, how does a change in spring activities, such as the timing or amount of egg production, influence autumn activities, for instance energy storage or migration? Trade-offs viewed in relation to individual lifetime fitness consequences couple these events. The framework of optimal annual routines provides theory and methodology for consistent analyses of these temporal trade-offs. Here I describe the key parts of optimal annual routine models and how the models can be used to: (i) study phenology, life-history strategies, and population dynamics; (ii) predict responses to environmental change; and (iii) guide future zooplankton studies. I mainly discuss the adaptations of zooplankton species inhabiting high latitude oceans where the seasonal cycle and its effects are particularly strong. Empirical challenges include issues of seasonal resolution, state-dependent processes and individual variability. Two ecological problems with avenues for future work are discussed in particular detail: the role of sea ice and ice algae in the life cycle of copepods and krill, and the adaptive value and ecological consequences of semelparous versus iteroparous reproductive strategies.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Hybrids between 2 abundant copepod species, Calanus glacialis and C. finmarchicus, were recently detected along the Atlantic and Arctic Canadian coast. Hybridization may affect population dynamics and, thus, impact local productivity. Our study aims to characterize the effect of hybridization on Calanus demography by comparing the in situ reproductive phenology and fitness of parental species and their hybrids. Environmental conditions were monitored and adult Calanus females were sampled in the upper layer in the St. Lawrence Estuary every second week from the pre-bloom (March to May) to bloom period (June to July) in 2010. Maximal abundance of hybrids (17\%) occurred in April between the maxima of C. glacialis (March) and C. finmarchicus (June). The different reproductive phenology of hybrids and parental species likely reduces interspecific gene flow. Contrastingly, fitness components such as the egg production rate of hybrids matched those of their maternal ancestor over the sampling interval. Still, hybrids represented only 10\% of total abundance, and their population-based egg production rate was always smaller than that of one parental species. The pre-bloom conditions during the peak abundance of hybrids may partially explain their small reproductive output in that area. Consequently, the impact of hybridization on the parental species’ population size seems small in 2010 in the St. Lawrence Estuary. However, long-term and spatial surveys are required to conclude on the general effect of hybridization on the population size of parental species over the vast area where they co-occur.},

This method is particularly advantageous in situations where cells or tissues are enriched for endogenous RNases or when separation of cytoplasmic RNA from nuclear RNA is impractical. TRIzol (or TRI Reagent) is a monophasic solution of phenol and guanidinium isothiocyanate that simultaneously solubilizes biological material and denatures protein. After solubilization, the addition of chloroform causes phase separation (much like extraction with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol), where protein is extracted to the organic phase, DNA resolves at the interface, and RNA remains in the aqueous phase. Therefore, RNA, DNA, and protein can be purified from a single sample (hence, the name TRIzol). TRIzol extraction is also an effective method for isolating small RNAs, such as microRNAs, piwi-associated RNAs, or endogeneous, small interfering RNAs. However, TRIzol is expensive and RNA pellets can be difficult to resuspend. Thus, the use of TRIzol is not recommend when regular phenol extraction is practical.},

	abstract = {The energy budget and the formation of sea ice in the eastern Weddell Sea west of Maud Rise are investigated on a regional scale on the basis of data obtained from drifting buoys deployed during the ANZFLUX project in 1994. A one-dimensional model for snow-covered sea ice and a kinematic-thermodynamic sea ice model for ice formed in leads are coupled and run under atmospheric and oceanic conditions specified from in situ data. Flooding at the snow-ice interface and snow ice formation need to be accounted for to achieve reasonable agreement between modeled and measured temperature distributions. The time-averaged values for the net heat flux are 21 W m−2, some 60\% of which originate in refreezing leads, and 9.8 cm for the monthly rate of ice accumulation. Whereas leads contribute a net accumulation of 10.8 cm, the mass balance of consolidated, snow-covered ice results in a net ablation of −1.0 cm. Sensitivity studies reveal the contribution of processes related to snow cover and ocean heat flux to sea ice formation and heat exchange. Without taking snow ice formation into account, a net ablation of −14.9 cm occurs under snow-covered ice due to high oceanic heat fluxes. A comparison between a simple two-layer model and the one-dimensional thermodynamic model emphasizes the influence of heat storage in sea ice on the development of heat flux and ice thickness. The heat and mass fluxes obtained on a regional scale, and their sensitivity to the parameterizations, elucidate the implication of vigorous small-scale processes on sea ice development and point out their importance for sea ice models.},

In addition, for several of the foregoing species, citrate synthase (CS) activities were examined in white skeletal muscle. In muscle, the activities of all these enzymes decrease exponentially with increasing minimum depth of occurrence of the species; this decrease closely parallels the decrease in respiratory rate found previously for these same species. The decline in enzymic activity with increasing minimum depth of occurrence is much greater than the decline in body protein content of the whole fishes, suggesting a disproportionately rapid fall in enzyme concentration in comparison to contractile and structural protein concentrations. The similar reductions in activities of both glycolytic (LDH and PK) and citric acid cycle (CS, MDH and IDH) enzymes with depth indicate that both standard and active metabolisms of deeper-dwelling species are reduced relative to shallower-dwelling forms. There is no suggestion of increased anaerobic capacity with depth or in relation to species, occurrence in the oxygen minimum layer. In brain and heart, there is no significant decrease in enzymic activity with increasing minimum depth of occurrence. These two tissues have similar capacities for metabolism in most fishes, when comparisons are based on enzymic activity per gram wet weight of tissue.},

These include provisioning of fishery products, nutrient cycling, climate regulation and the maintenance of biodiversity, with associated cultural and aesthetic benefits. Potential catch limits for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana) alone are equivalent to 11\% of current global marine fisheries landings. We also examine the extent to which decision-making within the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) considers trade-offs between ecosystem services, using the management of the Antarctic krill fishery as a case study. Management of this fishery considers a three-way trade-off between fisheries performance, the status of the krill stock and that of predator populations. However, there is a paucity of information on how well these components represent other ecosystem services that might be degraded as a result of fishing. There is also a lack of information on how beneficiaries value these ecosystem services. A formal ecosystem assessment would help to address these knowledge gaps. It could also help to harmonize decision-making across the ATS and promote global recognition of Southern Ocean ecosystem services by providing a standard inventory of the relevant ecosystem services and their value to beneficiaries},

They protect genomes from foreign nucleic acids. They can guide DNA synthesis or genome rearrangement.

Many, though not all, ncRNAs exploit the power of base pairing to selectively bind and act on other nucleic acids. Here, we describe the pathway of ncRNA research, where every established “rule” seems destined to be overturned.},

	abstract = {BackgroundAlthough much is known about how circadian systems control daily cycles in the physiology and behavior of Drosophila and several vertebrate models, marine invertebrates have often been overlooked in circadian rhythms research. This study focuses on the starlet sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis, a species that has received increasing attention within the scientific community for its potential as a model research organism. The recently sequenced genome of N. vectensis makes it an especially attractive model for exploring the molecular evolution of circadian behavior. Critical behavioral data needed to correlate gene expression patterns to specific behaviors are currently lacking in N. vectensis.Methodology/Principal FindingsTo detect the presence of behavioral oscillations in N. vectensis, locomotor activity was evaluated using an automated system in an environmentally controlled chamber. Animals exposed to a 24 hr photoperiod (12 hr light: 12 hr dark) exhibited locomotor behavior that was both rhythmic and predominantly nocturnal. The activity peak occurred in the early half of the night with a 2-fold increase in locomotion. Upon transfer to constant lighting conditions (constant light or constant dark), an approximately 24 hr rhythm persisted in most animals, suggesting that the rhythm is controlled by an endogenous circadian mechanism. Fourier analysis revealed the presence of multiple peaks in some animals suggesting additional rhythmic components could be present. In particular, an approximately 12 hr oscillation was often observed. The nocturnal increase in generalized locomotion corresponded to a 24 hr oscillation in animal elongation.Conclusions/SignificanceThese data confirm the presence of a light-entrainable circadian clock in Nematostella vectensis. Additional components observed in some individuals indicate that an endogenous clock of approximately 12 hr frequency may also be present. By describing rhythmic locomotor behavior in N. vectensis, we have made important progress in developing the sea anemone as a model organism for circadian rhythm research.},

	abstract = {Growth trends of Antarctic krill with sex, length, season, and region as independent variables were modelled with a linear mixed model (LMM) using 10 yr of accumulated instantaneous growth rate (IGR) measurements. A model of inter-moult period (IMP) as a function of temperature, required to convert IGR to daily growth rate, was fitted to data from published constant-tempera lure rearing studies; this model was used to predict seasonal IMP using a model of the average sea surface temperature seasonal trend for each region. Smaller krill exhibited higher growth rates and, in general, we observed a progressive decrease in IGR and daily growth with increasing size (from over 0.2 mm d(-1) down to 0.05 mm d(-1) for 20 and 50 rum krill, respectively, in December in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean). IGR decreased from summer to autumn, with small to negative values predominating across all length classes by autumn. December was a period of rapid growth in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean, whereas a similar peak in growth rates appeared to occur a few months earlier in the southwest Atlantic sector. Significantly lower growth rates were exhibited by females in January and February (e.g. 0.063 and 0.050 mm d(-1) for 40 mm females) compared to males (0.119 and 0.090 mm d(-1) for 40 mm males) in the Indian Ocean sector. Since these estimates were based on growth measurements of individual animals, they may reflect the occurrence of sex-differentiated growth patterns in the natural environment. Growth rate differences between sexes Suggested that growth rate estimates based on composite length frequency distributions without sex differentiation may be problematic.},

	abstract = {Antarctic krill maintain large population sizes despite dramatic seasonal fluctuations in food avail- ability, but the mechanisms for this are still debated. The aim of this study was to compare seasonal differ- ences in enzyme activity and respiration rates of larval and postlarval krill to provide insights into their overwintering strategies. Respiration rates, activity of the metabolic enzyme citrate synthase (CS), and those of the digestive enzymes laminarinase and total pro- teinase were measured in austral summer west of the Antarctic Peninsula, and in autumn in the southwestern Lazarev Sea. The 100-fold difference in chlorophyll a concentrations between the two studies is representative of the classic transition from a summer bloom to sparse winter conditions. Correspondingly, adult krill showed reduced respiration rates and CS activity in autumn. However, their digestive enzyme activity was signifi- cantly higher, suggesting more efficient assimilation of food at low food levels. Similar-sized larvae showed no summer-autumn differences in respiration rates and enzyme activity, supporting suggestions that they need to feed and grow year-round. However, trends in en- zymatic activity varied between the larval stages mea- sured, implying ontogenetic changes in body structure and function.},

At 0.0 degrees C N. concinna had higher Vv((mt,f)), Sv((im,mt)), Sv((im,f)) and muscle fibre specific CS activity than L. elliptica which correlated with the more active life style of N. concinna. However, mitochondrial density was very low, 1-2\% in both species, suggesting that low temperature compensation of mitochondrial density is not a universal evolutionary response of Antarctic marine ectotherms. Both Sv((im,mt)) and Sv((im,f)) were reduced by warm acclimation of N. concinna.

When food was restricted under experimental conditions, individual krill began to shrink immediately and mean population growth rates decreased gradually, becoming negative after as little as 7 d.

	abstract = {Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is a keystone species in the Southern Ocean. However, information on growth, diet and condition during winter and early spring is limited, hampering our understanding of these fundamental biological parameters at this important period in their lifecycle. Our study assessed diet and condition of larval and postlarval krill collected from open water and below the ice off East Antarctica (110-130 degrees E) in September/October 2007. Condition was assessed using lipid content, growth rates and digestive gland size; feeding history was assessed using fatty acid profiles and stomach content analysis; and a 207-day starvation study investigated the response of krill to long-term food deprivation. Potential food items (Calanus propinquus and sea-ice biota) were analysed for lipid and fatty acid composition to compare with krill samples. Krill were found to be in good condition, with mean growth rate of 0.95\% per moult for postlarvae and 14.79\% for larvae, and mean lipid content of 24.1\% for postlarvae and 6.6\% for larvae. Fatty acid profiles and stomach content analysis revealed two main feeding strategies - krill below the ice were feeding mostly on sea-ice diatoms, while those in open water were ingesting copepods and detritus. Krill below the ice had larger digestive glands than those in open water. Furciliae fatty acid profiles indicated a diet of heterotrophic flagellates and/or detritus. Postlarval krill survived 207 days of food deprivation by using body protein and lipid reserves for energy. In contrast, krill furciliae were severely depleted after just 5 days of food deprivation, indicating that they must feed continually at this time of year. Krill, copepods and sea-ice biota were all low in polyunsaturated fatty acids, indicating that krill must rely on later spring phytoplankton blooms to obtain these essential nutrients required for reproduction.

Elemental CHN analyses of total biomass and ash, therefore, provide a basis for the calculation of proximate biochemical composition and bomb caloric value. The classical nitrogen to protein conversion factor (6.25) should be replaced by 5.8±0.13. A linear relation exists between the mass fraction of non-protein carbon and the carbohydrate and lipid content. Residual water in dry organic matter can be estimated with the additional information derived from hydrogen measurements. The stoichiometric CHN method and direct biochemical analysis agreed within 10\% of ash-free dry biomass (for muscle, liver and fat tissue of silver carp; gut contents composed of detritus and algae; commercial fish food). The detrital material, however, had to be corrected for non-protein nitrogen. A linear relationship between bomb caloric value and organic carbon fractions was derived on the basis of thermodynamic and stoichiometric principles, in agreement with experimental data published for bacteria, algae, protozoa and invertebrates. The highly automatic stoichiometric CHN method for the separation of nutrient contents in biomass extends existing ecophysiological concepts for the construction of balanced carbon and nitrogen, as well as biochemical and energy budgets.},

When the density of the latter decreased, some improvements in fish stocks were recorded, which increased after the invasion of Beroe ovata, predator of Mnemiopsis.},

	abstract = {At least nine species of Calanidae occupy the area of interest, four in the Atlantic and five in the Pacific. All store wax esters and probably can undergo diapause. Latitudinally overlapping or onshore — offshore associations of two or more species occur in both oceans. Interzonals, with reduced mouth parts in the adult female, are endemic to the Pacific subarctic gyre where their life cycles are completed in one year. Presumably its nearly closed circulation and environmental stability have favored the evolution of endemic species well adapted to those conditions. Lack of ice- and/or salinity-induced stability also limits blooms there. The sub-arctic Atlantic contains several smaller oceanographic features, open to both arctic and Atlantic influences and populated by species of different origins, arctic species can behave as interzonals but may also require two or more years to complete their life cycles. Females may need to feed one year to reproduce the next and therefore they retain functional mouthparts. In some places in the North Atlantic, blooms may start in the sub-ice zone and seed the remaining euphotic zone. There the earliest stages of some the Calanus species can develop close to the ice, using primarily ice algae as food, while the remaining stages are adapted to utilize brief periods of intense primary production in the water column. Salinity-induced stability and shallow water favor blooms in the boundary waters of both oceans, which may be of greater importance in the Atlantic because of the proportionally greater area of continental shelf there. In both oceans the smaller species of Calanidae can produce up to three generations per year.},

	abstract = {Summary
Melatonin, the “hormone of darkness,” is a key regulator of vertebrate circadian physiology and behavior. Despite its ubiquitous presence in Metazoa, the function of melatonin signaling outside vertebrates is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the effect of melatonin signaling on circadian swimming behavior in a zooplankton model, the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii. We find that melatonin is produced in brain photoreceptors with a vertebrate-type opsin-based phototransduction cascade and a light-entrained clock. Melatonin released at night induces rhythmic burst firing of cholinergic neurons that innervate locomotor-ciliated cells. This establishes a nocturnal behavioral state by modulating the length and the frequency of ciliary arrests. Based on our findings, we propose that melatonin signaling plays a role in the circadian control of ciliary swimming to adjust the vertical position of zooplankton in response to ambient light.},

	abstract = {The dietary regulation of fatty acid synthesis de novo in two transplantable hepatomas, 7777 and 9618A, has been studied by comparison of the acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase activities of tumor and host liver, both in animals fasted 48 hours and in those subsequently refed a fat-free diet for 48 hours. Neither acetyl-CoA carboxylase nor fatty acid synthetase of these hepatomas was subject to the changes in enzyme concentration normally observed in host liver following dietary alteration. Thus, in livers of refed animals acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity was 12- to 29-fold greater than in the livers of fasted animals. Neither tumor studied showed any change in enzyme levels upon refeeding 48-hour fasted animals; 1.4 mµmoles of malonyl-CoA were formed per mg per min for hepatoma 7777 and 3.3 mµmoles of malonyl-CoA were formed per mg per min for hepatoma 9618A. These activities of enzyme are 5- to 10-fold greater than fasting levels in host liver.
Fatty acid synthetase levels in host livers increased 12- to 20-fold after refeeding. Again, neither tumor showed significant changes in enzyme activity upon refeeding fasted animals. Both acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase from hepatoma were inhibited by palmityl-CoA despite their lack of response to dietary alteration.
Acetyl-CoA carboxylase was purified 164-fold from rat liver and 67-fold from hepatoma 7777 to define further this lack of regulation. Studies of the purified enzymes disclosed that the tumor enzyme was essentially identical with that derived from liver in terms of heat inactivation, affinities for acetyl-CoA and ATP, activation and aggregation by citrate, product inhibition by malonyl-CoA, pH optima, and intrinsic specific activity as determined from biotin content.
These experiments suggest that the acetyl-CoA carboxylase from the tumors is the same enzyme as that from host liver, and that the increased activity in the tumors is due to an increased amount of enzyme rather than a structurally altered enzyme.},

Elemental analyses of the products (individually or collectively) permit one to calculate directly and simply the amount of substrate carbon and electrons which are conserved, and thus the amount of substrate required, and the respiratory gas exchanges associated with the synthesis. Glucose is taken as a standard substrate with the required amount termed Glucose Equivalent (GE, mol mol−1) or Glucose Value (GV, g g−1). Comparisons of GV with Production Values (PV) calculated from biochemical pathways (Penning de Vries, Brunsting and van Laar, 1974) show that PV = 0.88 ±0.01 GV. The glucose requirement also serves as a close predictor of the heat of combustion of the product.},

	abstract = {DNA-based techniques have proven useful for defining trophic links in a variety of ecosystems and recently developed sequencing technologies provide new opportunities for dietary studies. We investigated the diet of Australian fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) by pyrosequencing prey DNA from faeces collected at three breeding colonies across the seals' range. DNA from 270 faecal samples was amplified with four polymerase chain reaction primer sets and a blocking primer was used to limit amplification of fur seal DNA. Pooled amplicons from each colony were sequenced using the Roche GS-FLX platform, generating {\textgreater} 20,000 sequences. Software was developed to sort and group similar sequences. A total of 54 bony fish, 4 cartilaginous fish and 4 cephalopods were identified based on the most taxonomically informative amplicons sequenced (mitochondrial 16S). The prevalence of sequences from redbait (Emmelichthys nitidus) and jack mackerel (Trachurus declivis) confirm the importance of these species in the seals' diet. A third fish species, blue mackerel (Scomber australasicus), may be a more important prey species than previously recognised. There were major differences in the proportions of prey DNA recovered in faeces from different colonies, probably reflecting differences in prey availability. Parallel hard-part analysis identified largely the same main prey species as did the DNA-based technique, but with lower species diversity and no remains from cartilaginous prey. The pyrosequencing approach presented significantly expands the capabilities of DNA-based methods of dietary analysis and is suitable for large-scale diet investigations on a broad range of animals},

	abstract = {Midgut gland cells of Penaeus monodon postlarvae were investigated by electron microscopy after starvation and refeeding with different diets.

Well nourished postlarvae could be starved for 5 days without irreversible detriment. They recovered easily on a good diet. Only R cells were affected by a short starvation period. After 13 days of food deprivation the structures of all cell types were disintegrated. The postlarvae were able to starve for a maximum of 15 days. The most diversified ultrastructure was obtained by refeeding with cod liver oil and 2s (mixed diet). Casein was not well utilized. Sucrose was the poorest diet. The midgut gland of Penaeus monodon seems to be lipid oriented. Only fat was used as storage material; glycogen was lacking.

Different ultrastructures were induced in R cells by a given diet after longer starvation periods. The reestablishment of their ultrastructure by means of a definite diet seems to be impossible after a certain period of starvation (point of no return).

R cells are very sensitive to different diets. B cells show slight reactions, while F and E cells remain relatively unchanged. This indicates that R cells could be used to monitor the nutritional value of prawn diets in aquaculture.},

Genetic approaches in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, have revealed widely conserved molecular gears of these 24-h timers. Yet much less is known about how these cell-autonomous clocks confer temporal information to modulate cellular functions. Here we discuss our current knowledge of circadian clock function in Drosophila, providing an overview of the molecular underpinnings of circadian clocks. We then describe the neural network important for circadian rhythms of locomotor activity, including how these molecular clocks might influence neuronal function. Finally, we address a range of behaviors and physiological systems regulated by circadian clocks, including discussion of specific peripheral oscillators and key molecular effectors where they have been described. These studies reveal a remarkable complexity to circadian pathways in this “simple” model organism.},

	abstract = {The life cycle of Calanus finmarchicus in the lower St. Lawrence estuary is described based on observations of female egg production rate, population stage abundance, and chlorophyll a biomass collected over 7 years (19911997) at a centrally located monitoring station. The mean seasonal pattern shows maximum abundance of females in May, but peak population egg production rate and naupliar (N3N6) abundance occur in early July just after onset of the late spring  early summer phytoplankton bloom. The population stage structure is characterized by low summer abundance of early copepodite stages C1C3 and high stage C5 abundance in autumn. Between 1994 and 1997, there was important interannual variation in both timing (up to 1 month) and amplitude (five- to eight-fold) of population reproduction. Patterns of seasonal increase of C5 abundance in autumn suggest interannual variations of both timing and magnitude of deep upstream advection of this overwintering stage. Thus, the main features of C. finmarchicu..., Le cycle de vie de Calanus finmarchicus dans l'estuaire maritime du Saint-Laurent est décrit en utilisant des mesures du taux de production d'oeufs des femelles, d'abondance des différents stades de développement et de la biomasse phytoplanctonique (chlorophylle a) effectuées durant une période de 7 ans (1991 à 1997) à une station de monitorage située dans la partie centrale de la région. Le patron saisonnier moyen est caractérisé par un maximum d'abondance des femelles en mai, mais un pic de reproduction de la population et de l'abondance de nauplii (N3N6) au début juillet après l'amorce de la floraison du phytoplancton. La population montre une faible abondance des jeunes stades copépodites C1C3 en été et une abondance élevée du stade C5 à l'automne. Nous observons d'importantes variations interannuelles du moment (jusqu'à 1 mois) et de l'amplitude (cinq à huit fois) de la reproduction de la population.

Above a breakpoint temperature of 2$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C both routine (RMR) and standard metabolic rate (SMR) increased steeply. The fraction of metabolism allocated to SMR, as well as the number of intervals of elevated activity per hour increased significantly with temperature. During acute exposure, ATP concentrations in the foot muscle peaked at 2$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C and fell at 5$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C, whereas superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity decreased upon warming. Slow stepwise warming to a final temperature of 11$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C resulted in a significant decrease of SOD activity. Malondialdehyde concentration increased compared with controls at 0$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C. In contrast to the effect of short-term exposure, tissue adenylate concentrations displayed a mild increase at higher temperatures during slow warming, indicating an acclimation response. A switch to anaerobic energy production could not be observed up to 11$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C, demonstrating a higher level of thermal tolerance than in other Antarctic ectotherms, or a failure of the relevant pathways in Y.eightsi. The imbalance between pro- and antioxidant processes upon warming indicate oxidative stress to be one feature accompanying early heat stress in Y.eightsi.},

	abstract = {Metabolic adaptations to environmental changes were studied in Caenorhabditis elegans. To assess adjustments in enzyme function, maximum activities of key enzymes of main metabolic pathways were determined. After a 12 h incubation at varying temperatures (10, 20°C) and oxygen supplies (normoxia or anoxia), the activities of the following enzymes were determined at two measuring temperatures in tissue extracts: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; anaerobic glycolysis), 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA-dehydrogenase (HCDH; fatty acid oxidation), isocitrate dehydrogenases (NAD-IDH, NADP-IDH; tricarboxylic acid cycle) and isocitrate lyase (ICL; glyoxylate cycle). Incubation at 20°C induced a strong increase in maximum LDH activity. Anoxic incubation caused maximum HCDH and NADP-IDH activities and, at 10°C incubation, LDH activity to increase. Maximum NAD-IDH and ICL activities were not influenced by any type of incubation. In order to study the time course of metabolic adaptations to varying oxygen supplies, relative quantities of free and protein-bound NADH were determined in living C. elegans using time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. During several hours of anoxia, free and protein-bound NADH showed different time courses. One main result was that just at the moment when the protein-bound NADH had reached a constant level, and the free NADH started to increase rapidly, the worms fell into a rigor state. The data on enzyme activity and NADH fluorescence can be interpreted on the basis of a two-stage model of anaerobiosis.},

	abstract = {The ability to understand and predict the effects of environmental stress on biodiversity is becoming increasingly important in our changing environment. Antarctic marine species are some of the most stenothermal on the planet and many inhabit the waters off the Antarctic Peninsula which is one of the areas where there is rapid regional climate change. Therefore these animals are highly vulnerable to changing environmental temperatures and clearly we need to understand the complexities of their response, not just at the individual species level, but also the implications for the ecosystem as a whole. Heat shock proteins have a long history of use in studies of organism stress responses and have frequently been proposed as potential universal molecular biomarkers, especially for non-model species. In this mini-review, the heat shock response and heat shock proteins (specifically the \{HSP70\} family) are examined in Antarctic marine species alongside their physiological capabilities and limits to answer a series of questions: do these animals have a heat shock response which includes the expression of \{HSP70\} genes? What is the relationship between their heat shock response and physiological capabilities? Can \{HSP70\} genes be used as molecular biomarkers for these species?},

	abstract = {The metabolic rates (oxygen uptake, ammonia excretion, phosphate excretion) of epipelagic marine zooplankton have been expressed as a function of body mass (dry, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus weights) and habitat temperature, using the multiple-regression method. Zooplankton data used for this analysis are from phylogenetically mixed groups (56 to 143 species, representing 7 to 8 phyla, body mass range: 6 orders of magnitude) from various latitudes (habitat temperature range:-1.4° to 30°C). The results revealed that 84 to 96\% of variation in metabolic rates is due to body mass and habitat temperature. Among the various body-mass units, the best correlation was provided by carbon and nitrogen units for all three metabolic rates. Oxygen uptake, ammonia excretion and phosphate excretion are all similar in terms of body-mass effect, but differ in terms of temperature effect. With carbon or nitrogen body-mass units, calculated Q10 values are 1.82 to 1.89 for oxygen uptake, 1.91 to 1.93 for ammonia excretion and 1.55 for phosphate excretion. The effects of body mass and habitat temperature on the metabolic quotients (O:N, N:P, O:P) are insignificant. The present results for oxygen-uptake rate vs body mass do not differ significantly from those reported for general poikilotherms by Hemmingsen and for crustaceans by Ivleva at a comparable temperature (20°C). The importance of a body-mass measure for meaningful comparison is suggested by the evaluation of the habitat-temperature effect between mixed taxonomic groups and selected ones. Considering the dominant effects of body mass and temperature on zooplankton metabolic rates, the latitudinal gradient of community metabolic rate for net zooplankton in the ocean is estimated, emphasizing the non-parallelism between community metabolic rates and the standing stock of net zooplankton.},

	abstract = {The response of ice algae to low salinity was determined at three levels of silicate enrichment during the winter of 1992 in Saroma-ko Lagoon, Hokkaido, Japan. Regardless of the silicate concentration, the chlorophyll a content decreased by 50\% of its initial value within the first day of exposure to low salinity water (22 psu) and continued to decrease gradually thereafter. The degree of decrease after the first day was a function of silicate concentration. The size distribution of the ice algae at the beginning of the incubation was 52\% in the size class \&gt; 10 μm, 39\% in 10-2 μm and 9\% in 2-0.2 μm. Within two weeks of silicate enrichment, the 2-0.2 μm fraction decreased to less than 1\% while the \&gt; 10 μm fraction increased to more than 90\%. Low salinity and low silicate concentrations reduced the chlorophyll a biomass and photosynthetic activity. Silicate enrichments, even at the low salinity, enhanced photosynthetic activity and the relative abundance of the \&gt; 10 μm cells. Our results suggest that ice algae may not survive if trapped in the low salinity lens that is present immediately below the ice during melting because of possible osmotic damage associated with silicate deficiency. However, ice algal cells may recover from the damage when they sink into the high salinity and silicate-rich underlying water in Saroma-ko Lagoon. The ecological role of low salinity water is discussed in relation to vertical flux of ice algae.},

	abstract = {Mammalian pyruvate kinase (PK), a key glycolytic enzyme, has two genes named PKL and PKM, which produce the L- and R-type isoenzymes by means of alternative promoters, and the M1-and M2-types by mutually exclusive alternative splicing respectively. The expression of these genes is tissue-specific and under developmental, dietary and hormonal control. The L-type isoenzyme (L-PK) gene contains multiple regulatory elements necessary for regulation in the 5 flanking region, up to position -170. Both L-II and L-III elements are required for stimulation of L-PK gene transcription by carbohydrates such as glucose and fructose, although the L-III element is itself responsive to carbohydrates. The L-II element is also responsible for the gene regulation by polyunsaturated fatty acids. Nuclear factor-1 proteins and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4, which bind to the L-II element, may also be involved in carbohydrate and polyunsaturated fatty acid regulation of the L-PK gene respectively. However, the L-III-element-binding protein that is involved in carbohydrate regulation remains to be clarified, although involvement by an upstream stimulating factor has been proposed. Available evidence suggests that the carbohydrate signalling pathway to the L-PK gene includes a glucose metabolite, possibly glucose 6-phosphate or xylulose 5-phosphate, as well as phosphorylation and dephosphorylation mechanisms. In addition, at least five regulatory elements have been identified in the 5 flanking region of the PKM gene up to position -279. Sp1-family proteins bind to two proximal elements, but the binding of proteins to other elements have not yet been clarified. Glucose may stimulate the transcription of the PKM gene via hexosamine derivatives. Sp1 may be involved in this regulation via its dephosphorylation, although the carbohydrate response element has not been determined precisely in the PKM gene. Thus glucose stimulates transcription of the PKM gene by the mechanism which is probably different from the L-PK gene.},

	abstract = {The daily rhythm of 24 h and the annual rhythm of 12 mo constitute the 2 major, highly predictable rhythms of the biosphere. The internal circadian clock enables organisms to track daily changes in their environment; the photoperiodic timer, alone or in concert with a circannual clock, enables organisms to anticipate and prepare in advance for seasonal changes in their environment. The circadian clock entrains to dawn and dusk and tracks light and temperature on a day-to-day basis, while the photoperiodic timer serves as a long-term, physiological go/no-go switch that commits an animal to development, reproduction, dormancy, or migration on a seasonal or even lifetime basis. In 1936, Erwin Bünning proposed that circadian rhythms formed the basis (Grundlage) for photoperiodic response to day length. Historical inertia generated by correlative evidence from early physiological studies and a proliferating number of descriptive models has resulted in the widespread assumption that the circadian clock constitutes the necessary, causal basis of photoperiodism in general. This historical inertia has also restricted the search for genes involved in insect photoperiodism to genes central to the circadian clock in Drosophila and has led investigators to conclude that any behavior, process, or gene expression that varies with day length represents photoperiodism or a gene involved in photoperiodism. The authors discuss how blinders imposed by the circadian imperative have retarded progress toward identifying the genetic basis of photoperiodism and how the insights gained from geographic variation in photoperiodic response have been used to show the independent evolution of the circadian clock and photoperiodism. When geographic variation is found in circadian genes, the most immediate and parsimonious search for adaptive significance should be in circadian function, not in extrapolation to photoperiodism. Finally, the authors propose that circadian-unbiased, forward genetic approaches should be used to identify genes involved in photoperiodism within extant populations and among populations over evolutionary time.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Variability is a key feature of the pelagic ecosystems of the Southern Ocean and an important aspect of the variation is fluctuation in the abundance of krill Euphausia superba Dana, the major prey item of many of the higher predators. Direct impacts of variability in the large-scale physical environment, such as changes in ocean circulation, have been suggested as the main factor generating the observed fluctuations. So far, however, there has been little quantitative assessment of the importance of krill population dynamics in the observed variation. Here, analyses of a model of krill population development and predator diet data from South Georgia have been used to examine seasonal changes in the population structure of krill. The krill population model was combined with a size-based selection function and used to generate expected length-frequency distributions in the predator diet through a summer season. Comparison of the model solutions with the predator diet data indicates that the model can reproduce the observed pattern of variation and emphasizes that adult population changes are a key aspect of the interannual fluctuations observed during some years. Low krill abundance was associated with reduced representation of the 3+ age group (3 to 4 yr old), whereas when krill were abundant the 3+ age class was the major age group present. The seasonal changes in the population structure in the predator diet involve a complex interaction of relative year class strength, timing of immigration, fluctuations in growth rates and dynamic predator-selective effects. Development of the model to examine the interactive effects of changing krill growth and mortality rates will be a valuable next step. The dominance of the changes in krill population age structure underlines the fact that to understand the variability of the South Georgia ecosystem we must identify the major factors generating variability in population dynamics throughout the Scotia Sea.},

	abstract = {Much of the distribution range of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is covered by permanent or seasonal sea ice. Sea ice extent has been implicated as a major factor affecting reproductive success of krill and krill dispersal, but little is known of the way in which ice cover may influence krill behaviour. This is largely because the under-ice environment is difficult to study. Ship-borne echosounders have, however, detected krill aggregations in midwater in ice-covered regions. We used 120-kHz echograms collected underway during three cruises that crossed ice-covered and adjacent open waters in the Bellingshausen, Weddell, and Scotia seas to compare morphological and next-neighbour characteristics of krill swarms within and without ice cover. No significant differences were detected between the hori- zontal and vertical extent of swarms or swarm next-neighbour distance in ice-covered or open waters. Distributions of swarm mid-depths did, however, differ significantly between ice-covered and open areas in all three seas, although the direction of difference was not the same in each instance: swarms in the Weddell and Scotia seas were generally shal- lower under ice than in open water, whereas in the Bellingshausen Sea the opposite prevailed.},

	abstract = {The valve area of Fragilariopsis kerguelensis, the most abundant diatom species in the Southern Ocean, strongly changes in size in response to varying conditions in the surface ocean. We examined the link, both in two iron fertilization experiments and in sediment samples covering several glacial Terminations, between size variability in this species and environmental conditions across the Antarctic Polar Front, including sea ice extent, sea surface temperature, and the input of eolian dust. The iron fertilization experiments show valve area to be positively correlated with iron concentrations in ambient waters, which suggests the possibility of a causal relation between valve size of Fragilariopsis kerguelensis and ambient surface water iron concentration. Larger valves are usually found during glacial times and thus seem to be related to lower sea surface temperature and wider sea ice coverage. Moreover, our results indicate that there usually is a strong correlation between larger valve size and increased input of eolian dust to the Southern Ocean. However, this correlation, obvious for the fertilization experiments and for glacial Terminations I, II, III, and V, does not seem to be valid for Termination VI, where size appears to be inversely correlated to dust input.},

	abstract = {The annual advance and retreat of sea ice has been considered a major physical determinant of spatial and temporal changes in the structure of the Antarctic coastal marine ecosystem. However, the role of glacial meltwater on the hydrography of the Antarctic Peninsula ecosystem has been largely ignored, and the resulting biological effects have only been considered within a few kilometers from shore. Through several lines of evidence collected in conjunction with the Palmer Station Long-Term Ecological Research Project, we show that the freshening and warming of the coastal surface water over the summer months is influenced not solely by sea ice melt, as suggested by the literature, but largely by the influx of glacial meltwater. Moreover, the seasonal variability in the amount and extent of the glacial meltwater plume plays a critical role in the functioning of the biota by influencing the physical dynamics of the water (e.g., water column stratification, nearshore turbidity). From nearly a decade of observations (1991–1999), the presence of surface meltwater is correlated not only to phytoplankton blooms nearshore, but spatially over 100 km offshore. The amount of meltwater will also have important secondary effects on the ecosystem by influencing the timing of sea ice formation. Because air temperatures are statistically increasing along the Antarctic Peninsula region, the presence of glacial meltwater is likely to become more prevalent in these surface waters and continue to play an ever-increasing role in driving this fragile ecosystem.},

	abstract = {The analysis of food webs and their dynamics facilitates understanding of the mechanistic processes behind community ecology and ecosystem functions. Having accurate techniques for determining dietary ranges and components is critical for this endeavour. While visual analyses and early molecular approaches are highly labour intensive and often lack resolution, recent DNA-based approaches potentially provide more accurate methods for dietary studies. A suite of approaches have been used based on the identification of consumed species by characterization of DNA present in gut or faecal samples. In one approach, a standardized DNA region (DNA barcode) is PCR amplified, amplicons are sequenced and then compared to a reference database for identification. Initially, this involved sequencing clones from PCR products, and studies were limited in scale because of the costs and effort required. The recent development of next generation sequencing (NGS) has made this approach much more powerful, by allowing the direct characterization of dozens of samples with several thousand sequences per PCR product, and has the potential to reveal many consumed species simultaneously (DNA metabarcoding). Continual improvement of NGS technologies, on-going decreases in costs and current massive expansion of reference databases make this approach promising. Here we review the power and pitfalls of NGS diet methods. We present the critical factors to take into account when choosing or designing a suitable barcode. Then, we consider both technical and analytical aspects of NGS diet studies. Finally, we discuss the validation of data accuracy including the viability of producing quantitative data},

	abstract = {To survive long periods of low food availability, some calanoid copepods have a life his-tory that includes a diapause phase during which copepodids delay development to adulthood, migrate to depth, reduce metabolism, and utilize stored lipids for nourishment. While seasonal pat-terns in diapause have been described, the environmental and physiological regulation of diapause has not been elucidated. We collected Calanus finmarchicusC5 copepodids from surface (0 to 39 m) and deep (157 to 201 m) waters in the Gulf of Maine, and both morphological and biochemical mea-surements indicated that these copepodids were from active and diapausing populations, respec-tively. Two complementary molecular techniques were used to compare gene expression in these 2 groups: (1) suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) was used to identify genes that may be differ-entially expressed, and (2) quantitative real-time RT-PCR was used to characterize patterns of gene expression in individual copepodids. Three genes associated with lipid synthesis, transport and storage (ELOV, FABP, RDH) were upregulated (more highly expressed)in active copepods, particu-larly those with small oil sacs. Expression of ferritin was greater in diapausing copepods with large oil sacs, consistent with a role of ferritin in chelating metals to protect cells from oxidative stress and/or delay development. Ecdysteroid receptor (EcR) expression was greater in diapausing cope-pods, highlighting the need for further investigation into endocrine regulation of copepod develop-ment. This study represents the first molecular characterization of gene expression associated with calanoid copepod diapause and provides a foundation for future investigations of the underlying mechanisms that regulate diapause.},

Differences in vertical distribution between stations partly reflected a south–north gradient in developmental progress with higher abundance of older stages in the southern locations. The C. finmarchicus and M. longa observations were consistent with the hypothesis that the developmental stages distributed according to certain preferences for light intensity, and different optical properties at the four locations are likely to have affected the vertical distributions. Diel vertical migration was only observed for older developmental stages of M. longa while young stages of M. longa remained in deep waters both day and night. A mortality index indicated that non-migrating Calanus spp. suffered higher mortality than migrating M. longa.},

	abstract = {Using systems for long-term maintenance of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba in aquaria, positive growth was measured in a large number of specimens under controlled conditions. The first moult always showed the greatest growth increment. The high laboratory growth rates agreed with previous field investigations. Often-reported 'abnormal' slow and predominantly negative growth was probably due to inadequate maintenance procedures. Moulting was partly synchronous, and moult frequency was temperature dependent. Growth of Antarctic krill did not match the slow rates expected of a polar species. Krill was very sensitive to experimental variation in feeding regime: (1) moult frequency (14 to 29 d) and (2) growth increment at moult (-15 to 21 \%) varied together. Ecdysis and the staging and timing of the moult cycle were studied. The stage definitions of Buchholz (1982; Mar. Biol. 66: 301-305) were expanded and are now applicable to frozen krill and for field investigations, and include a simple classification key. Regular histological changes in the integument and consistent changes in the titre of the moult hormone could be attributed to distinct stages of the moult cycle. A clear temporal correlation confirmed the physiological relevance of the staging system. A possible 'resting' stage between post- and pre-ecdysis was not found. The apparent plasticity of growth parameters indicates that, in the wild, krill is able to adapt to strong regional and seasonal changes in feeding conditions, typical for Antarctic waters. Krill grows fast, and in spite of being predominantly planktonic, attains a large size. This enables fast swimming which facilitates location of rich food sources. Favourable feeding conditions immediately initiate growth. Essentially unhindered motility during actual moult and extremely fast ecdysis were interpreted as an adaptation to a pelagic way of life.},

Sars, 1885 were scarce in spring (September 27 to October 6, 1971) and mainly present at the Calyptopis I stage, while in summer (December 17, 1974 to January 3, 1975) they were much more abundant and much further developed (up to Furcilia VI). The spawning season commences as early as September and, as indicated by the presence of numerous nauplii and metanauplii in summer, is rather long. T. macrura begins to spawn much earlier in West-Wind-Drift waters than in waters of the Weddell Sea. It starts to spawn simultaneously with Euphausia frigida and E. triacantha, but significantly earlier than E. superba. These timings of the breeding process are related to differential biogeographical characteristics of these species. Plankton collections made at depths of 500 or 1000 m have, for T. macrura, revealed a “developmental ascent” analogous to that of E. superba. Ontogenetical deep-water migrations are, consequently, characteristic not only for E. superba, but also for other Antarctic euphausiids (in particular E. frigida, but possibly not for inshore E. crystallorophias) and, as correctly postulated by several other investigators, for all oceanic euphausiid species.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-protein diets have been shown to increase energy expenditure (EE). OBJECTIVE: The objective was to study whether a high-protein, carbohydrate-free diet (H diet) increases gluconeogenesis and whether this can explain the increase in EE. DESIGN: Ten healthy men with a mean (+/-SEM) body mass index (in kg/m(2)) of 23.0 +/- 0.8 and age of 23 +/- 1 y received an isoenergetic H diet (H condition; 30\%, 0\%, and 70\% of energy from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively) or a normal-protein diet (N condition; 12\%, 55\%, and 33\% of energy from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively) for 1.5 d according to a randomized crossover design, and EE was measured in a respiration chamber. Endogenous glucose production (EGP) and fractional gluconeogenesis were measured via infusion of [6,6-(2)H(2)]glucose and ingestion of (2)H(2)O; absolute gluconeogenesis was calculated by multiplying fractional gluconeogenesis by EGP. Body glycogen stores were lowered at the start of the intervention with an exhaustive glycogen-lowering exercise test. RESULTS: EGP was lower in the H condition than in the N condition (181 +/- 9 compared with 226 +/- 9 g/d; P {\textless} 0.001), whereas fractional gluconeogenesis was higher (0.95 +/- 0.04 compared with 0.64 +/- 0.03; P {\textless} 0.001) and absolute gluconeogenesis tended to be higher (171 +/- 10 compared with 145 +/- 10 g/d; P = 0.06) in the H condition than in the N condition. EE (resting metabolic rate) was greater in the H condition than in the N condition (8.46 +/- 0.23 compared with 8.12 +/- 0.31 MJ/d; P {\textless} 0.05). The increase in EE was a function of the increase in gluconeogenesis (DeltaEE = 0.007 x Deltagluconeogenesis - 0.038; r = 0.70, R(2) = 0.49, P {\textless} 0.05). The contribution of Deltagluconeogenesis to DeltaEE was 42\%; the energy cost of gluconeogenesis was 33\% (95\% CI: 16\%, 50\%). CONCLUSIONS: Forty-two percent of the increase in energy expenditure after the H diet was explained by the increase in gluconeogenesis. The cost of gluconeogenesis was 33\% of the energy content of the produced glucose},

	abstract = {Investigations performed in the last decade indicate that there have been important changes in the zooplankton composition and structure in the Black Sea. However, contrasting events taking place in different regions of the Black Sea indicate a non-uniform structure of its ecosystem.

Several fodder zooplankton species have either disappeared from or substantially decreased in number at different sampling sites of the Black Sea over the last one or two decades. Some other species adapted to thrive in eutrophic conditions have either appeared or increased in quantity. Meanwhile the biomass of the fodder zooplankton has also fluctuated considerably through the years. However, there seems to be a reverse trend in the long-term variation of fodder zooplankton between the shallow western and deep eastern areas. Over the last few decades the abundance of fish larvae has decreased significantly when compared either to past records or with larval abundances of other seas. This was shown to be due mainly to malnutrition of larvae. One of the most striking changes in the ichthyoplankton has been the shift in the spawning areas of the main fish species, the anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus from the northwestern to the southeastern Black Sea. Even the invading ctenophore Mnemiopsis were found to be starving. The condition of other species (Calanus euxinus and Pleurobrachia pileus) disclosed the fact that cyclonic regions where chlorophyll and nutrient concentrations are high, provide better nutrition than anticyclonic regions.},

	abstract = {The data from this study demonstrates for the first time that Neurospora crassa, a circadian
model organism, has a photoperiodic clock. The experiments provide the opportunity
for further research on photoperiodism. Evidence of this study supports the
external coincidence hypothesis that photoperiodism shares the same mechanism with
circadian rhythms. The central components of the Neurospora circadian clock, such
as FRQ and WC-1, are also essential for photoperiodic responses. The dissociation
between frq RNA and FRQ protein in different photoperiods suggests that the transcriptional/
translational regulation is far complicated. The shift of the maximum of
conidial production compared to protoperithecia development suggests the different
favourite season for the asexual and sexual reproduction of Neurospora crassa.
However, there is a difference between circadian rhythm and photoperiodism --
circadian rhythm is endogenous, which remains at constant conditions (DD or LL); in
contrast, photoperiodism requires external signals – light and darkness.
Further research on photoperiodism of Neurospora must be carried out to study
the gene(s) which is/are critical for photoperiodic responses, the molecular mechanism
of transcriptional/translational regulation of critical clock components in photoperiods,
the generation of the oscillator, and the mechanism which differentiates
many outputs of photoperiodic responses.},

	abstract = {Antarctic krill is a cold water species, an increasingly important fishery resource and a major prey item for many fish, birds and mammals in the Southern Ocean. The fishery and the summer foraging sites of many of these predators are concentrated between 0$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$ and 90$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$W. Parts of this quadrant have experienced recent localised sea surface warming of up to 0.2$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C per decade, and projections suggest that further widespread warming of 0.27$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$ to 1.08$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C will occur by the late 21st century. We assessed the potential influence of this projected warming on Antarctic krill habitat with a statistical model that links growth to temperature and chlorophyll concentration. The results divide the quadrant into two zones: a band around the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in which habitat quality is particularly vulnerable to warming, and a southern area which is relatively insensitive. Our analysis suggests that the direct effects of warming could reduce the area of growth habitat by up to 20\%. The reduction in growth habitat within the range of predators, such as Antarctic fur seals, that forage from breeding sites on South Georgia could be up to 55\%, and the habitats ability to support Antarctic krill biomass production within this range could be reduced by up to 68\%. Sensitivity analysis suggests that the effects of a 50\% change in summer chlorophyll concentration could be more significant than the direct effects of warming. A reduction in primary production could lead to further habitat degradation but, even if chlorophyll increased by 50\%, projected warming would still cause some degradation of the habitat accessible to predators. While there is considerable uncertainty in these projections, they suggest that future climate change could have a significant negative effect on Antarctic krill growth habitat and, consequently, on Southern Ocean biodiversity and ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {The metabolic carbon requirements and excretion rates of three major zooplankton groups in the Southern Ocean were studied in February 2009. The research was conducted in the framework of the ATOS research project as part of the Spanish contribution to the International Polar Year. The objective was to ascertain the possible consequences of the predicted zooplankton shift from krill to salps in the Southern Ocean for the cycling of biogenic carbon and the concentration and stoichiometry of dissolved inorganic nutrients. The carbon respiratory demands and NH4-N and PO4-P excretion rates of {\textless}5 mm size copepods, krill and salps were estimated by incubation experiments. The carbon-specific metabolic rates and N:P metabolic quotients of salps were higher than those of krill (furcilia spp. and adults) and copepods, and as expected there was a significant negative relation between average individual zooplankton biomass and their metabolic rates, each metabolic process showing a particular response that lead to different metabolic N:P ratios. The predicted change from krill to salps in the Southern Ocean would encompass not only the substitution of a pivotal group for Antarctic food webs (krill) by one with an indifferent trophic role (salps). In a zooplankton community dominated by salps the respiratory carbon demand by zooplankton will significantly increase, and therefore the proportion of primary production that should be allocated to compensate for the global respiratory C-losses of zooplankton. At the same time, the higher production by salps of larger, faster sinking fecal pellets will increase the sequestration rate of biogenic carbon. Similarly, the higher N and P excretion rates of zooplankton and the changes in the N:P stoichiometry of the metabolic products will modify the concentration and proportion of N and P in the nutrient pool, inducing quantitative and qualitative changes on primary producers that will translate to the whole Southern Ocean ecosystem.},

	abstract = {The antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is considered a success in the intensely seasonal environment of the Southern Ocean because of its abundance and central role as an important food item for many of the larger carnivores in the ecosystem. The behavioral and physiological characteristics that foster this success are: (1) the ability to find concentrations of food in several types of habitat and efficiently exploit whatever food is available; (2) the close correspondence of the life cycle with seasonal cycles of food availability; and (3) a combination of physiological mechanisms that enable krill to survive the long winter period of low food availability. We evaluated the relative importance of the following four major winter-over mechanisms that have been proposed for adult krill west of the Antarctic Peninsula. The three-fold reduction in metabolic rate is the most important winter-over mechanism for these adults, although lipid utilization and shrinkage also help satisfy energy requirements in the winter. Alternate food sources did not appear to contribute significantly as a winter energy source. However, the extent, predictability and complexity of the ice cover in a region during winter may have a great influence on the relative importance of these winter-over mechanisms for different populations. Ice cover in the waters west of the Antarctic Peninsula is unpredictable and smooth surfaced when it occurs, providing the krill with little refuge from predation. In multi-year pack ice of the Weddell Sea, however, ice cover is predictable and extensive, and there is a complex undersurface that provides hiding places. In this multi-year ice, adult krill have been observed under the ice feeding, whereas west of the Antarctic Peninsula most adult krill are in the water column in the winter and are not feeding. The balance between acquiring energy and avoiding predation may be different in these two regions in the winter because of differences in predictability and complexity of the ice cover.},

The technique allows us to provide comprehensive information on statistical parameters of climate for every day of an observational period. Using daily data, the technique has no problems caused by different lengths of months or the leap-year cycle. Without needing to assume the stationarity of contemporary climate, the technique allows the study of statistical parameters of climatic records of arbitrary length. We illustrate the technique with applications to trends in the satellite observed variations of sea ice extent in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. We show that a significant part of the variability in hemispheric sea ice extents for the period 1978–1999 is related to linear trends.},

The current world catch of all species of krill is over 150 000 tonnes per annum but few fisheries are being exploited to their maximum theoretical potential. The size of the world krill harvest is currently limited by lack of demand, although some fisheries are being deliberately managed at low levels because of ecological concerns. We have outlined the history of these krill fisheries to determine where there are common trends and issues which will affect their future development. Krill products are currently mostly used for the aquaculture and sport fishing market but considerable effort has also been put into developing products for human consumption, particularly from Antarctic krill. The future development of krill fisheries is examined in the light of information on trends in krill products which include pharmaceutical and industrial uses in addition to nutritional products. Because of the central ecological role of krill in many marine ecosystems, the subject of krill harvesting is a sensitive issue and krill fisheries require careful management. This requirement has spawned an innovative international management regime in the Antarctic — the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) — which has developed procedures for managing the harvest of Antarctic krill that may be applicable to other fisheries. The common problems of managing krill fisheries are outlined particularly those relating to the role of krill in many coastal ecosystems, and as prey for many other species which are commercially fished.},

	abstract = {Activities and characteristics of two metabolic key enzymes, citrate synthase (CS) and pyruvate kinase (PK), were studied in the Northern krill, Meganycti-phanes norvegica, with respect to adaptive properties under different thermal conditions. Krill were sampled during late winter/spring and summer from the con-stantly warm Ligurian Sea (12-13$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C below thether-mocline), the colder but also comparatively constant Clyde Sea (7-8$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C), and the variable Kattegat (2-16$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C). Both enzymes showed distinct tissue-andorgan-specific activities, which were highest in the pleopods - the principal locomotive organs. The fourth and fifth abdominal segments, however, were used for routine investigation due to lowest variability. Specific activity of CS and PK did not differ between seasons in krill from the Kattegat or the Clyde Sea. In the Ligurian Sea, in contrast, specific CS activities were significantly lower during summer. Analysis of individual datail-lustrated a decrease of CS activity with size and an increase of PK activity with size. Taking theseallo-metric effects into account, as emphasized by calculat-ing the ratio between both enzymes, variation of CS and PK activities turned out to be solely dependent on body size, which differed between locations andsea-sons. Ligurian krill from the summer, however, were unique in that they showed a lower CS/PK ratio than would be predicted by the scaling effect. Thermal characteristics of each enzyme were similar between locations and seasons. During the winter, in Kattegat and Clyde Sea krill, Km values (Michaelis-Menten constant) of CS towards acetyl-coenzyme A exhibited an almost constant level over the experimental temperature range of 4-16$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C. During summer, however, Km values were lower at 8$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C in the Clyde Sea and at 12$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C in the Kattegat. In Ligurian krill from thesum-mer, Km values were consistently lower than those of winter krill over the entire experimental temperature range. In conclusion, Kattegat and Clyde Sea krill show only minor adaptations to their respectivether-mal environments in terms of CS and PKcharacteris-tics. Ligurian krill, in contrast, exhibited decreased specific CS activity during summer, which might be compensated by elevated enzyme-substrate affinity as indicated by lower Km values. Since temperature was constant during both seasons, this effect cannot be explained as a reaction to thermal conditions.Conse-quently, oligotrophic conditions in the Ligurian Sea during summer may entail a reduction in the somatic performance of krill, which is reflected by lower CS activity.},

Fecal pellets were collected at 170 m depth in a moored sediment trap from January 2004 to January 2009. Fecal pellet shape and size (i.e., carbon content) were quantified to assess flux of pellets from different zooplankton taxa and compared between seasons and years. Fecal pellet POC constituted the dominant proportion of total POC flux, with summer (November to April) pellet POC flux (67\%) significantly higher than winter (May to October) pellet POC flux (34\%), while phytodetritus or fecal ‘fluff’ constituted the remainder. Cylindrical euphausiid pellets contributed to a monthly mean of 72\% of total fecal pellet flux; ovoid copepod and tabular salp pellets contributed significantly less (22 and 6\%, respectively). Cylindrical and ovoid pellet export was significantly higher in summer, while 48\% of tabular pellet flux occurred in winter. Tabular pellets had the highest carbon content (median = 1.03 µgC pellet−1, highest 134.9 µgC pellet−1), followed by cylindrical (0.20 µgC pellet−1) and ovoid (0.04 µgC pellet−1) pellets. As krill fecal pellets are the dominant component of particle export in the WAP, we hypothesize that a decrease in krill and increase in salps in the region could alter the export of POC to the deep sea.},

	abstract = {An oceanographic field program called the Antarctic Zone Flux experiment was carried out in the eastern Weddell Sea during austral winter (July–September) 1994. Data from a drift buoy array were used in concert with shipboard observations to provide exceptionally high horizontal resolution of upper ocean hydrographic parameters near Maud Rise. Chemical and tracer data were obtained from the ship. We identify a “warm pool” southwest of the rise as a dynamically necessary region of positive (cyclonic) vorticity that is associated with a Taylor column over the rise. Both a warm “halo” surrounding the Taylor column and the warm pool are associated with thermocline shoaling that is a necessary condition for high upward heat fluxes to occur. These features extend the influence of Maud Rise bottom topography on upper ocean heat flux over a region that is larger, by a factor of at least 2, than the area directly overlying the rise. Areal mean upward heat fluxes of about 25 W m−2 are derived using both upper ocean T (“instantaneous”) values and tracer data (“integrated”) values. Fluxes derived over the warm halo and pool regions using only upper ocean T exceeded 100 W m−2 at specific sites. Elsewhere in the region, the T-derived heat fluxes varied widely from {\textless}10 to {\textgreater}50 W m−2, whereas the tracer-derived heat fluxes showed a considerably more uniform distribution. Our mean values are similar to those that have been previously reported. Historical ice cover data have shown that the geographical region encompassed by Maud Rise and the warm pool area to the southwest is a preferred site for polynya formation, consistent with these findings. Time series analyses of the historical upper ocean data set suggest that conditions conducive to polynya formation are correlated with climate processes remote from the Southern Ocean.},

	abstract = {Several experiments were conducted with starved and fed females of the Arctic copepod Calanus hyperboreus (1) to investigate their lifespan, reproductive period, egg production and egg viability; (2) to study the effect of origin, i.e., Atlantic and Arctic Waters in the Greenland Sea, on the timing of reproduction; and (3) to study the effect of time of collection on the onset of reproductive activity as a first approach to study control mechanisms of the reproductive cycle. Females collected in October produced up to 1,000 eggs and had a maximum lifespan of 164 days without feeding, whereas fed females produced up to ca. 6,000 eggs and survived up to 806 days. These observations support earlier assumptions that females were multiannual-iteroparous, i.e., capable to spawn in successive years, which would be unique for calanoid copepods. In starved females, clutch size decreased significantly with each spawning event. Viable eggs were produced during most of the life time. There was no difference in the timing of reproductive activity between females from the West Spitsbergen Current and the Greenland Sea Gyre. Fed and starved females collected in May and June began to spawn circa 2 and 4 months after collection, respectively, whereas females collected in August and October started spawning at the same time, in the middle of October. This indicates initiation of reproductive activity in the field in August, coincident with the descent into deep waters. Potential cues for the untimely spawning of females collected in spring and ‘unnatural’ feeding in fall experiments are discussed. Their large size, robustness and combination of different types of diapause in their life cycle make C. hyperboreus a good model organism to study diapause control mechanisms.},

In particular, seasonal changes in environmental light regimes have been shown to strongly influence krill metabolism, representing control signals for seasonal regulation of physiology of this key Southern Ocean species. Here, we report the identification of a cryptochrome gene, a cardinal component of the clockwork machinery in several organisms. EsCRY appears to be an ortholog of mammalian-like CRYs and clusters with the insect CRY2 subfamily. EsCRY has the canonical bipartite CRY structure, with a conserved N-terminal domain and a highly divergent C-terminus, that bears several binding motifs, some of them shared with insect CRY2 and others peculiar for EsCRY. We have evaluated the temporal expression of Escry both at mRNA and protein levels in individuals harvested from the Ross Sea at different times throughout the 24 h cycle during the Antarctic summer. We observed a daily fluctuation in abundance for Escry mRNA in the head, with high levels around 06:00 h, which is not mirrored by a cycle in the corresponding protein. Our findings represent a first step toward establishing the presence of an endogenous circadian time-keeping mechanism that might allow this organism to synchronize its physiology and behavior to the Antarctic light regimes.},

Krill have long been recognized as key prey species for fish, birds, and marine mammals and as a target for fisheries in both hemispheres. However, the study of krill can contribute in many other ar- eas of biology. Krill are an excellent model system for studies of growth and maturity, for connections between theory, experiment, and observation, and for tests of evolutionary theory in the field. Krill are also ideal model organisms for studying the interaction between environmental and organismal variability. Because they are widely distributed but only moderately speciose, the study of krill can also shed light on the relationship between abundance and range. The study of krill is an inherently interdisciplinary field, crossing boundaries and using a combination of oceanography, biochem- istry, physiology, evolution, and ecology to understand krill and their role in the ecosystem.},

	title = {Molecular adaptation and thermal plasticity in a cold-adapted {Antarctic} fish},
	abstract = {Evolutionary adaptation and the connected acclimation capacity of species to changing environmental conditions represents one of the key factors in the composition and dynamics of any ecosystem. In marine environments temperature is one of the major factors defining the aquatic fauna. In respect to progressing climate change the question arises how individual species react to higher temperatures and how this affects the entire ecosystem. Species that are highly specialized on stable environmental conditions seem to be especially vulnerable. This thesis characterizes the Antarctic eelpout Pachycara brachycephalum (Pappenheim, 1912) in regards to its adaptation to low habitat temperatures as well as its capacity to acclimate to higher temperatures at the molecular level. A cDNA library was established and subjected to high-throughput sequencing to provide a basis for sequence analyses. To characterize differences between a cold-adapted and a eurythermal species, an already existing cDNA library of the closely related congener Zoarces viviparus (Linnaeus, 1758) was included in large-scale comparisons. The repertoire of functional genes reflected cold-adaptation features of cellular metabolism in P. brachycephalum, e.g. through a higher ratio of ubiquitin-related genes. These genes are of great importance in cold-adaptation and counter the cold denaturation of proteins. Furthermore, the amino acid sequences of orthologous proteins displayed differences between the eury- and the stenotherm. The observed position-specific interchanges in P. brachycephalum highly conform with the flexibility hypothesis. According to this hypothesis a protein may be destabilized in its three-dimensional structure by minimal changes within the amino acid sequence. This destabilization sustains reaction kinetics in the cold. In addition, differences were noted in the encoding of amino acids at DNA level. Within homologous proteins of P. brachycephalum amino acids are encoded with a preference for AT-richer triplets on the third codon position. This trend promotes less stable transitional states at this level, too, as the base pairing of AT is less stable than that of GC. This may facilitate transcription and translation in the cold and thus constitute an adaptation to the habitat conditions of the Antarctic eelpout. For studying the plasticity of this species in more detail, various acclimation experiments were conducted. At first, the chronology of warm acclimation was established by means of enzyme measurements as well as through expression analyses of various candidate genes. Through this the mechanisms that account for metabolic changes in the warmth could be identified at the protein as well as the transcriptomic level. The observed shift from lipid-based to carbohydrate-based metabolism provided evidence that the Antarctic eelpout prepares for hypoxemic conditions. The shift to carbohydrate-fuels is advantageous under anaerobic conditions, which may be elicited by warmer temperatures, due to elevated oxygen demand insufficiently met by the limited capacity of the circulation/respiration system. Various transcriptomic factors of the PPAR family were identified as important mediators of the metabolic shift. These nuclear-located receptors measure the energy status within a cell and regulate the expression of various genes involved in lipid- and carbohydrate metabolism. The expression profiles of all 26 genes examined, provided an acclimation time course that can be divided into 3 phases: acute, mid-term and long-term. Another experiment was dedicated to the compilation of expression profiles of long-term acclimated specimens held at 6 different temperatures ranging from -1 to 9$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C over a time period of 2 months. A total of 664 temperature-sensitive transcript sequences could be identified by using a custom microarray design based on the sequence information of the cDNA library. The growth optimum of the Antarctic eelpout was characterized by the smallest transcriptomic changes, i.e. the least regulatory effort. The differently expressed functions revealed specific patterns for the temperature ranges cold, intermediate and warm, with specific features in energy metabolism. Again, the aforementioned metabolic shift could be observed, with additional indicators for a potential use of amino acids as an energy reserve in the cold. Further differences between acclimation temperatures in processes like transcription, translation, protein degradation or the organization of the cytoskeleton are discussed with respect to their implications for metabolic energy consumption. Furthermore, regulatory mechanisms increasing the proliferation of blood vessels that obviously modify the cardio-vascular system to counter an oxygen limitation have been identified in the warmth. Beyond an acclimation temperature of 6$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C an extreme energy deficit is indicated by a severe weight loss of the specimen. This was accompanied by a classic cellular stress response, signifying an essential threshold temperature of the thermal window of P. brachycephalum. Overall, by combining various experimental approaches covering the entire thermal tolerance window and beyond, the correlation between the molecular and the whole animal level was established. The Antarctic eelpout displays capacities to acclimate to temperatures above the range of habitat temperatures. This thesis highlights the complexity of molecular adaptation at DNA, RNA and protein levels as well as various functional shifts in metabolism enabling life at various acclimation temperatures. The present findings help to substantiate the framework of the oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance at the molecular level.},

	abstract = {The Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, has a key position in the Southern Ocean food web by serving as direct link between primary producers and apex predators. The south-west Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, where the majority of the krill population is located, is experiencing one of the most profound environmental changes worldwide. Up to now, we have only cursory information about krill's genomic plasticity to cope with the ongoing environmental changes induced by anthropogenic CO2 emission. The genome of krill is not yet available due to its large size (about 48 Gbp). Here, we present two cDNA normalized libraries from whole krill and krill heads sampled in different seasons that were combined with two data sets of krill transcriptome projects, already published, to produce the first knowledgebase krill ‘master’ transcriptome. The new library produced 25\% more E. superba transcripts and now includes nearly all the enzymes involved in the primary oxidative metabolism (Glycolysis, Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation) as well as all genes involved in glycogenesis, glycogen breakdown, gluconeogenesis, fatty acid synthesis and fatty acids β-oxidation. With these features, the ‘master’ transcriptome provides the most complete picture of metabolic pathways in Antarctic krill and will provide a major resource for future physiological and molecular studies. This will be particularly valuable for characterizing the molecular networks that respond to stressors caused by the anthropogenic CO2 emissions and krill's capacity to cope with the ongoing environmental changes in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean.},

	abstract = {Abstract The vertebrate endocrine system is well-characterized, with many reports of disruption by environmental chemicals. In contrast, cnidarians are less compartmentalized, physiological regulation is poorly understood, and the potential for disruption is unknown. Endocrine-like activity has not been systematically studied in cnidarians, but several classical vertebrate hormones (e.g., steroids, iodinated organic compounds, neuropeptides, and indoleamines) have been identified in cnidarian tissues. Investigators have made progress in identifying putative bioregulatory molecules in cnidarians, and testing the effects of these individual compounds. Less progress has been made in elucidating signaling pathways. For example, putative gonadotropin-releasing hormone and sex steroids have been identified in cnidarian tissues, but it is unknown whether these compounds are components of a larger signal cascade comparable to the vertebrate hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Further, while sex steroids and iodinated organic compounds may help to regulate cnidarian physiology, the mechanisms of action are unknown. Homologs to the vertebrate steroid and thyroid receptors have not been identified in cnidarians, so more research is needed to understand the mechanisms of endocrine-like signaling in cnidarians. Elucidation of cnidarian regulatory pathways will provide insight into evolution of hormonal signaling. These studies will also improve understanding of how cnidarians respond to environmental cues and will provide a basis to investigate disruption of physiological processes by physical and chemical stressors.},

Even though the crustacean hyperglycemic hormones (CHHs), produced by perikarya in the medulla terminalis X-organ and released from the sinus glands, are among the best known crustacean neuropeptides, their physiological role in metabolic regulation is far from clear. 2. Previous experiments with eyestalk extract or partially purified preparations have provided evidence of an activating effect on phosphorylase and an inhibitory one on glycogen synthase. It is likely that CHH has this dual role, but the details remain to be confirmed by experiments with pure hormone, particularly with regard to the effects on the phosphorylase system. 3. There is evidence in the literature that glycolysis in crustacean tissues may be controlled by an eyestalk factor, and recent results suggest that this factor may be CHH. 4. The pentose phosphate pathway has been suggested, about 30 years ago, to be under the control of two eyestalk factors. Until now no significant efforts have been made to identify any of them, one of which may be CHH. 5. Although the main metabolic pathways of carbohydrate metabolism have been demonstrated in crustaceans, very little is known about their operation under altered environmental and/or physiological conditions, and even less about their endocrine control. There is evidence that CHH may have a more prominent, central role in such control than has been assumed thus far.},

	abstract = {The Southern Ocean is an extreme environment, where waters are permanently cold, a seasonal ice cover extends over large areas, and the solar energy available for photosynthesis is severely restricted, either by vertical mixing to considerable depths or, especially south of the Antarctic Circle, by prolonged seasonal periods of low or no irradiance. Such conditions would normally lead to low productivity and a water column dominated by recycling processes involving microbial components of pelagic communities but this does not seem to be the case in the Southern Ocean, where there is efficient export to large apex predators and deep waters. This paper investigates the role of large microphagous zooplankton (salps, krill, and some large copepods) in the partitioning of biogenic carbon among the pools of short- and long-lived organic carbon and sequestered biogenic carbon. Large microphagous zooplankton are able to ingest microbial-sized particles and thus repackage small, non-sinking particles into both metazoan biomass and large, rapidly sinking faeces. Given the wide spatio-temporal extent of microbial trophic pathways in the Southern Ocean, large zooplankton that are omnivorous or able to ingest small food particles have a competitive advantage over herbivorous zooplankton. Krill efficiently transfer carbon to a wide array of apex predators and their faecal pellets are exported to depth during occasional brief sedimentation episodes in spring time. Salps may be a significant link towards some fish (directly) and other apex predators (indirectly) and, at some locations (especially in offshore waters) and time, they may account for most of the downward flux of biogenic carbon. Large copepods are a trophic link towards fish and at least one whale species, and their grazing activity generally impedes the export of organic particles to depth. As a result, biogenic carbon is channelled mainly towards apex predators and episodically into the deep ocean. Without these original interactions, Antarctic waters might well be dominated by microbial components and recycling processes instead of active export from the generally small primary producers towards large apex predators.},

	abstract = {Virtually all species have developed cellular oscillations and mechanisms that synchronize these cellular oscillations to environmental cycles. Such environmental cycles in biotic (e.g. food availability and predation risk) or abiotic (e.g. temperature and light) factors may occur on a daily, annual or tidal time scale. Internal timing mechanisms may facilitate behavioural or physiological adaptation to such changes in environmental conditions. These timing mechanisms commonly involve an internal molecular oscillator (a ‘clock’) that is synchronized (‘entrained’) to the environmental cycle by receptor mechanisms responding to relevant environmental signals (‘Zeitgeber’, i.e. German for time-giver). To understand the evolution of such timing mechanisms, we have to understand the mechanisms leading to selective advantage. Although major advances have been made in our understanding of the physiological and molecular mechanisms driving internal cycles (proximate questions), studies identifying mechanisms of natural selection on clock systems (ultimate questions) are rather limited. Here, we discuss the selective advantage of a circadian system and how its adaptation to day length variation may have a functional role in optimizing seasonal timing. We discuss various cases where selective advantages of circadian timing mechanisms have been shown and cases where temporarily loss of circadian timing may cause selective advantage. We suggest an explanation for why a circadian timing system has emerged in primitive life forms like cyanobacteria and we evaluate a possible molecular mechanism that enabled these bacteria to adapt to seasonal variation in day length. We further discuss how the role of the circadian system in photoperiodic time measurement may explain differential selection pressures on circadian period when species are exposed to changing climatic conditions (e.g. global warming) or when they expand their geographical range to different latitudes or altitudes.},

The resulting rate of evolution of age and size at maturity was similar to rates typically obtained for traits subjected to artificial selection in laboratory settings and up to seven orders of magnitude greater than rates inferred from the paleontological record. Male traits evolved more rapidly than female traits largely because males had more genetic variation upon which natural selection could act.

	abstract = {The climate of the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is the most rapidly changing in the Southern Hemisphere, with a rise in atmospheric temperature of nearly 3$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C since 1951 and associated cryospheric impacts. We demonstrate here, for the first time, that the adjacent ocean showed profound coincident changes, with surface summer temperatures rising more than 1$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C and a strong upper-layer salinification. Initially driven by atmospheric warming and reduced rates of sea ice production, these changes constitute positive feedbacks that will contribute significantly to the continued climate change. Marine species in this region have extreme sensitivities to their environment, with population and species removal predicted in response to very small increases in ocean temperature. The WAP region is an important breeding and nursery ground for Antarctic krill, a key species in the Southern Ocean foodweb with a known dependence on the physical environment. The changes observed thus have significant ecological implications. Citation: Meredith, M. P., and J. C.

Those individuals that previously had been exposed to fish factor were considerably more sensitive to light than untreated larvae and showed a panic response when suddenly illuminated.},

Our major observations are: (1) respiration rates were reduced by 30 to 50\% in autumn and winter, compared to values in late spring; (2) feeding activity was reduced by 80 to 86\% in autumn and winter, compared to late spring, at similar food concentrations; (3) feeding was omnivorous during winter; (4) with each moult, krill grew by 0.5 to 3.8\% in length; (5) body lipids and, to a small extent, body proteins were consumed during winter. Adult Euphausia superba thus adopt metabolic slowdown and omnivorous feeding activity at low rates to survive the winter season in the Lazarev Sea. By mid autumn, metabolic activity is reduced, most likely being influenced by the Antarctic light regime, which is accompanied by a reduction in feeding activity and growth. Although at a low level, the feeding activity during winter seems to provide an important energy input.},

Stage composition was used as an indicator for successful growth; gonad maturity and egg production were taken as indicators for reproductive activity. On the Arctic Ocean transects, these parameters were measured simultaneously from the sibling species Calanus glacialis. Response of egg production rate to different temperatures at optimal food conditions was very similar between both species in the laboratory. C. finmarchicus was present at all stations studied, but young developmental stages were only present close to the regions of submergence of Atlantic water under the Polar water. This together with a decreasing abundance and biomass from west to east along the Atlantic Inflow in the Arctic Ocean and reproductive failure indicates that C. finmarchicus is expatriated in the Arctic Ocean. We hypothesize that the late availability of food in the Arctic Ocean, rather than low temperature per se, limits reproductive success. Better reproductive success in the very low temperature regions of the Return Atlantic Current and the marginal ice zone in the Greenland Sea supports this hypothesis. The possibility for a replacement of C. glacialis by C. finmarchicus and consequences for the ecosystem after increasing warming of the Arctic are discussed.},

Based on Bongo net hauls between 200 m or 500 m and the surface, abundances of 18 frequently occurring zooplankton taxa, including copepods, appendicularians, larval fish Pleuragramma antarcticum, and developmental stages of Euphausia superba, Euphausia crystallorophias, and Thysanoessa macrura were analyzed. Variability of zooplankton was high in later summer. Larval krill (E. superba), virtually absent in January occurred at mean abundances of more than 1000 individuals/100 m3 in February, when numbers of other herbivorous zooplankton were 2.2 times lower than in January. In October-November, abundances of surface zooplankton were about 10 times lower than January values. The entire matter column on the shelf contained appr. five times less zooplankton in later winter than the upper 200 m in summer.},

	abstract = {Krill in captivity endure spatial restrictions, regardless of the size or shape of tank used. Visual inspection of freshly caught and captive animals suggests that their appendages, particularly the antennae and antennules, are often subject to injury. We have developed a novel method for reducing physical damage to captive krill based on their reported reaction to feeding whales. This method involves creating a bubble curtain that keeps the krill in the centre of the tank and away from potentially damaging hard surfaces. There was no difference in the length of the antennae between any of the captive animals. Trends in the data suggest that the antennules of krill maintained in a 200?L bubble curtain tank and a1000?L holding tank, were longer and less variable in length, than for krill in a 200?L tank with no bubble curtain. Freshly caught krill from the field were found to have damage to both antennae and antennules. The implications of these findings for husbandry of krill and for behavioural studies in the laboratory are discussed.},

	abstract = {1. The activities of fructose 1,6-diphosphatase were measured in extracts of muscles of various physiological function, and compared with the activities of other enzymes including phosphofructokinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and the lactate-dehydrogenase isoenzymes. 2. The activity of phosphofructokinase greatly exceeded that of fructose diphosphatase in all muscles tested, and it is concluded that fructose diphosphatase could not play any significant role in the regulation of fructose 6-phosphate phosphorylation in muscle. 3. Fructose-diphosphatase activity was highest in white muscle and low in red muscle. No activity was detected in heart or a deep-red skeletal muscle, rabbit semitendinosus. 4. The lactate-dehydrogenase isoenzyme ratio (activities at high and low substrate concentration) was measured in various muscles because a low ratio is characteristic of muscles that are more dependent on glycolysis for their energy production. As the ratio decreased the activity of fructose diphosphatase increased, which suggests that highest fructose-diphosphatase activity is found in muscles that depend most on glycolysis. 5. There was a good correlation between the activities of fructose diphosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in white muscle, where the activities of these enzymes were similar to those of liver and kidney cortex. However, the activities of pyruvate carboxylase and glucose 6-phosphatase were very low in white muscle, thereby excluding the possibility of gluconeogenesis from pyruvate and lactate. 6. It is suggested that the presence of fructose diphosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in white muscle may be related to operation of the alpha-glycerophosphate-dihydroxyacetone phosphate and malate-oxaloacetate cycles in this tissue},

	volume = {209},
	abstract = {Although Antarctic krill live in a relatively harsh and variable environment, they are extremely abundant and occur across a wide geographic range. Krill are also the dominant prey item for a variety of predators ranging from fish to whales. Thus, krill life histories and survival strategies represent an interesting and biologically relevant theoretical question: How do krill survive and what makes them so successful? The factors that influence krill size and spatial distributions and life-history patterns are not generally understood. We present a conceptual framework for studying krill life histories and patterns of distribution. This approach uses what is known about krill physiology and environmental conditions within an evolutionary framework to increase our understanding of krill distributions and abundance. Using a dynamic state-variable model, we determined the factors predicted to affect the distribution of krill among habitats and feeding behavior of krill. Habitats vary in their associated survival, predation risk, food availability, and metabolic costs. Existing data on variation in temperature, phytoplankton abundance, metabolic costs, growth rates and predator behavior are used to parameterize the model. The model predicts that krill will shrink when experi-encing extreme temperatures or food deprivation (under negative energy budgets), but we also pre-dict that krill may shrink due to predation risk (under positive energy budgets). Furthermore, preda-tion patterns are predicted to strongly influence krill size and spatial distributions. If predation risk is size-dependent, krill are predicted to shrink between reproductive events which reduces predation. Differences between habitats in predation risk may cause krill to shift away from risky habitats even if this slows growth. In the presence of predation risk when feeding, krill are predicted to experience a tradeoff between growth and survival and shift their feeding behavior and habitat distribution accordingly. Differences between habitats in water temperature and travel costs are also predicted to cause size-dependent shifts in habitat use and migration behavior. Our results reinforce the impor-tance of predator behavior on krill life histories, growth, and distributions. Patterns of predation risk may be the key to understanding krill distribution in space, time and size.},

	abstract = {Antarctic fishes and invertebrates, including Antarctic krill, are generally stenothermal, and it is necessary to maintain water temperature about 0$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C to keep them in good condition. Because the effects of nitrifying bacteria are limited by the extremely low temperature of about 0$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C, biological filtration does not keep up with the deterioration of water quality resulting from the excrement of animals and un-eaten food. It is therefore necessary to exchange seawater frequently in our present cold-water aquarium. We developed a new system at Port of Nagoya Public Aquarium (PNPA) that keeps Antarctic marine animals in good condition. The improved system increases the temperature of sea water to 10$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C prior to biological filtration and thereby increases the effectiveness of the biological filter. The krill-rearing container was constructed inside the main tank so that the water flow inside the rearing container could be stopped. This avoids a rapid reduction of phytoplankton feed due to turnover of the seawater in the system while krill were fed. As a result of these improvements, long-term rearing, mass culture and reproduction of Antarctic krill are possible. We have exhibited Antarctic marine animals since the opening of PNPA in 1992, and we have exhibited Antarctic krill continuously since 1997. In this article, we detail the Antarctic krill breeding facilities at PNPA.},

	abstract = {Developments during the past 20 years are reviewed for four aspects of crustacean growth. These are the hormonal control of moulting, the effects of external factors on growth rate, the patterns of growth and the determination of age. Hormonal control. The nature and structure of Moult Inhibiting Hormone has been determined, though the mechanism by which it inhibits crustecdysone production is still unclear. A role in moult control by Crustacean Hyperglycaemic Hormone has been demonstrated, but needs clarification. Methyl farnesoate, a juvenile hormone like substance, occurs in Crustacea: however, a clear function as a juvenile hormone has yet to be shown. External factors. The effect of increased temperature in reducing moult increments is supported by further data. Reduced food supply causes smaller moult increments and longer intermoult periods: the latter effect is generally proportionately greater. A role for CHH in this process is hypothesised. Patterns of growth. Little advance has occurred in understanding the rationale for the diversity of growth patterns. Computer modelling offers promise, but is constrained by lack of data on natural mortality for validation. Determination of age. The basic methods available remain size frequency analysis and tagging programmes. There have been advances in technology and methods of analysis, but no major breakthrough. Novel methods include radionuclide ratios (expensive, complex and give only duration of current intermoult), lipofuschin pigment assay (promising, but needs further validation), and annular structures in the infra-cerebral organ (still very speculative).},

	doi = {10.1016/j.cub.2013.08.038},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tidal (12.4 hr) cycles of behavior and physiology adapt intertidal organisms to temporally complex coastal environments, yet their underlying mechanism is unknown. However, the very existence of an independent "circatidal" clock has been disputed, and it has been argued that tidal rhythms arise as a submultiple of a circadian clock, operating in dual oscillators whose outputs are held in antiphase i.e., 12.4 hr apart. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the intertidal crustacean Eurydice pulchra (Leach) exhibits robust tidal cycles of swimming in parallel to circadian (24 hr) rhythms in behavioral, physiological and molecular phenotypes. Importantly, 12.4 hr cycles of swimming are sustained in constant conditions, they can be entrained by suitable stimuli, and they are temperature compensated, thereby meeting the three criteria that define a biological clock. Unexpectedly, tidal rhythms (like circadian rhythms) are sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of Casein kinase 1, suggesting the possibility of shared clock substrates. However, cloning the canonical circadian genes of E. pulchra to provide molecular markers of circadian timing and also reagents to disrupt it by RNAi revealed that environmental and molecular manipulations that confound circadian timing do not affect tidal timing. Thus, competent circadian timing is neither an inevitable nor necessary element of tidal timekeeping. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that tidal rhythms are driven by a dedicated circatidal pacemaker that is distinct from the circadian system of E. pulchra, thereby resolving a long-standing debate regarding the nature of the circatidal mechanism},

The life span of Antarctic krill exceeds 5 years in both the Cosmonaut and Cooperation seas. The age composition of the southern and northern groupings differs markedly, with substantial reduction in numbers of early age groups in the northern grouping. Long-term observations of spawning success, recruitment, and age composition suggest that a self-sustained grouping of krill persists in the Cooperation Sea south of the Antarctic Divergence. How- ever, periodic gene flow via recruits from surrounding regions most probably accounts for the lack of spatial genetic differences between the Cooperation Sea and adjacent areas, thus preventing the establishment of an isolated subpopulation in the region investigated. The major factor responsible for the substantial interannual variability in krill dynamics appears to be macroscale oceanographic and atmospheric circulations, which determine a level of environ- mental isolation of the Cooperation Sea from adjacent waters.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.dsr.2008.12.007},
	abstract = {Despite much research on Euphausia superba, estimates of their total biomass and production are still very uncertain. Recently, circumpolar krill databases, combined with growth models and revisions in acoustics have made it possible to refine previous estimates. Net-based databases of density and length frequency (KRILLBASE) yield a summer distributional range of 19  106 km2 and a mean total abundance of 8  1014 post-larvae with biomass of 379 million tonnes (Mt). These values are based on a standardised net sampling method but they average over the period 1926-2004, during which krill abundance has fluctuated. To estimate krill biomass at the end of last century we combined the KRILLBASE map of relative krill density around Antarctica with an acoustics-derived biomass estimate of 37.3Mt derived for the Scotia Sea area in 2000 by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). Thus the CCAMLR 2000 survey area contains 28\% of the total stock, with total biomass of 133Mt in January-February 2000. Gross postlarval production is estimated conservatively at 342-536 Mt yr?1, based on three independent methods. These are high values, within the upper range of recent estimates, but consistent with the concept of high energy throughput for a species of this size. The similarity between the three production estimates reflects a broad agreement between the three growth models used, plus the fact that, for a given population size, production is relatively insensitive to the size distribution of krill at the start of the growth season. These production values lie within the envelope of what can be supported from the Southern Ocean primary production system and what is required to support an estimated predator consumption of 128-470Mt yr?1. Given the range of recent acoustics estimates, plus the need for precautionary management of the developing krill fishery, our net-based data provide an alternative estimate of total krill biomass.},

	abstract = {Krill have been viewed as difficult animals to examine experimentally. Consequently, most information on growth and age of these pelagic crustaceans has come from demographic studies on preserved specimens. Only one species of krill, Euphausia superba, has been intensively studied in the laboratory, but the experimental findings on growth and age from these studies have fundamentally altered our perceptions of the population biology of this species. Most other species of krill remain in the preexperimental phase of understanding; thus, there remain considerable un- certainties regarding their growth and longevity. Unfortunately, these uncertainties are often ignored in ecological stud- ies. In this paper, I have examined the role that experimental studies have played in increasing knowledge of the population biology of krill, particularly in the fields of growth and aging. I have indicated where discrepancies exist between field-based and experimental approaches and I outline some approaches for exploring these discrepancies and suggest some potentially fruitful areas for future research.},

	abstract = {The neuroendocrine control of spawning (release of intact gamete follicles) and of the ensuing exfoliation (freeing of gametes by follicle epithelium rupture) was investigated in colonies of the sea pansy Renilla koellikeri, an octocorallian of the sea pen family. Polyps of male colonies produce substantially more sperm follicles than female colonies do egg follicles, and significantly more sperm follicles are expelled than egg follicles during the summer spawning season. Spawning is accompanied by strong peristaltic contractions across the colony. Serotonin, a positive modulator of peristalsis in the sea pansy, induced spawning of either sperm or egg follicles, increasing both the proportion of spawning colonies and the number of expelled gamete follicles per colony in a dose-dependent manner. The serotonin antagonist 1-(1)naphthylpiperazine greatly reduced both spontaneous and serotonin-induced spawning. Antho-RFamide, a neuropeptide found in ciliated neurons within follicle epithelia, induced the exfoliation of the follicle epithelium from spawned follicles. Exposure of follicles to light enhanced the potency of Antho-RFamide. The actin-binding toxin phalloidin substantially reduced the incidence of Antho-RFamide-induced exfoliation and phalloidin-FITC staining was localized in the muscle feet of follicle epithelial cells. These results provide the first experimental evidence of neuroendocrine functions involved in cnidarian spawning.},

Calyptopes were not found below 1000 m but large numbers were present in the upper 500 m, predominantly in the 100–30 m layer. The herbivorous copepod, Calanoides acutus, was confined closer to the surface. The omnivorous copepod, Metridia gerlachei, occurred at depths {\textgreater} 100 m, down to 500 m. It was the most abundant copepod found in the central Scotia Sea. In the eastern Weddell Sea, E. superba larvae occurred together with larvae of Euphausia crystallorophias which were more abundant. Euphausia superba larvae tended to congregate at greater depths (between 200 and 300 m) than those of E. crystallorophias which were most abundant near the surface.},

Compared with wild animals starved E. superba decreased their oxygen uptake, ammonia excretion and phosphate excretion considerably (2452\%), but no significant changes in wet: dry wt ratio, and chemical compositions (C, N, P) were observed. The mortality of the starved group was similar to that of controls fed Tetra Marin and frozen copepods and less than that of controls fed a mixture of microalgae (Dunaliella and Phaeodactylum). Because of insufficient lipid storage, E. superba is hypothesized to switch from herbivorous feeding to omnivorous or carnivorous during the Antarctic winter. The present results suggest, however, that body shrinkage could be an alternative way for this animal to conserve energy during the winter. The advantage of this is discussed in the light of the characteristics of body structure and life style of E. superba.},

	abstract = {High latitudes are characterized by strong seasonal changes in environmental conditions, including temperature and food availability. To cope with these changes, many high latitude species have developed circannual oscillators that enable them to anticipate and prepare for forthcoming environmental changes and synchronize seasonal events (e.g. reproduction) to environmental fluctuations. The Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) is the world's northernmost freshwater fish species with a distribution largely confined within the Arctic. In the northernmost part of its distribution they have developed an anadromous life-history strategy implying annual, seaward migrations in the summer to utilize the rich feeding opportunity in the sea. Overwintering in freshwater is characterized by anorexia and energy conservation. The seaward migration in early summer is preceded by physiological and behavioral changes (smolting), by which they develop seawater tolerance (hypoosmoregulatory ability) and migratory behavior. When migrating to the sea, Arctic charr have regained a strong appetite and within 4–6 weeks in the sea they may have doubled their body weight and increased their body fat stores several-fold, in anticipation of the resources needed for reproduction in the autumn and overwintering. All these processes are regulated independently of environmental changes; captive offspring of anadromous charr kept in freshwater displays seasonal changes in seawater tolerance and strong seasonal changes in food intake and growth even when they are continuously fed in excess and held at a constant water temperature in freshwater. A correct timing of these events is crucial for their survival in the Arctic and the Arctic charr seems to possess timing mechanisms that include endogenous, circannual oscillator(s) entrainable by photoperiod. The entrainment mechanism may be linked to diel melatonin rhythms, which in this species exactly mirror overground photoperiod, even during the winter residence in lakes with thick ice and snow. Little is known, however, about how photoperiod, melatonin and putative endogenous clock(s) interact in the generation of seasonal rhythms in fish, and downstream neuroendocrine mechanisms leading to physiological changes. The anadromous Arctic charr seems ideal as a model for studying such mechanisms.},

	abstract = {In calanoid copepods it is poorly understood how enzymatic activities and patterns are affected by abiotic and biotic factors. Such knowledge, however, is crucial to assess metabolic functioning and performance of organisms in different habitats. Therefore, our study focuses on digestive enzyme activities in relation to temperature, pH and food in the Arctic species Calanus glacialis and in Centropages hamatus and Temora longicornis from the North Sea. Enzyme activities were measured over a range from 0 to 70$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C (lipases/esterases, proteinases) and pH 5 to 9 (proteinases). In all species, relative proteinases activity peaked at 40/50$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C and pH 6; relative lipases/esterases activity peaked at 30$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C. Between 0 and 20$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C, lipase activity of C. glacialis was higher (40-70\% of maximum) than that of the boreal copepods (25-64\%), which suggests thermal adaptation of the lipid metabolism in the polar species. Incubating C. glacialis with the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii showed (i) that enzyme activities increased especially in the alkaline range and (ii) that enzyme patterns, revealed by gel electrophoresis, differed from that of starving individuals, indicating that feeding induced enzyme expression. Such studies, linking abiotic and biotic conditions to enzyme functioning, can help elucidating the capacity of copepods to respond to environmental changes},

High proliferation rates (10\% nuclei dividing) and apoptosis in tissues of A. opercularis were in line with high-energy throughput and reduced investment into antioxidant defence mechanisms in the scallop. In contrast, cell turnover was slow ({\textless}1\% nuclei dividing) in A. islandica and similar in mantle, gill and adductor muscle between young and old individuals. In the heart, cell turnover rates decreased with age, which indicates less-efficient removal of damaged cells in ageing A. islandica. Cell turnover rates, mass specific respiration and antioxidant enzyme activities were similar in German Bight and Iceland ocean quahog. Variable maximum life expectancies in geographically separated A. islandica populations are determined by extrinsic factors rather than by fundamental physiological differences.},

	abstract = {Collective behaviour enhances environmental sensing and decision-making in groups of animals. Experimental and theoretical investigations of schooling fish, flocking birds and human crowds have demonstrated that simple interactions between individuals can explain emergent group dynamics. These findings indicate the existence of neural circuits that support distributed behaviours, but the molecular and cellular identities of relevant sensory pathways are unknown. Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster exhibits collective responses to an aversive odour: individual flies weakly avoid the stimulus, but groups show enhanced escape reactions. Using high-resolution behavioural tracking, computational simulations, genetic perturbations, neural silencing and optogenetic activation we demonstrate that this collective odour avoidance arises from cascades of appendage touch interactions between pairs of flies. Inter-fly touch sensing and collective behaviour require the activity of distal leg mechanosensory sensilla neurons and the mechanosensory channel NOMPC. Remarkably, through these inter-fly encounters, wild-type flies can elicit avoidance behaviour in mutant animals that cannot sense the odour—a basic form of communication. Our data highlight the unexpected importance of social context in the sensory responses of a solitary species and open the door to a neural-circuit-level understanding of collective behaviour in animal groups.},

	abstract = {Two copepod species, Calanus finmarchicus (a widespread North Atlantic species) and C. glacialis (an Arctic species), are dominant in the zooplankton of Arctic seas. We hypothesized that the anticipated warming in the Arctic might have different effects on the arctic and boreal species. The effect of temperature on egg production rate (EPR) in these species at temperatures of 0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10°C under contrasting feeding conditions was assessed in 5-day-long experiments. The EPR of the fed C. finmarchicus increased with temperature over the entire tested range. On the contrary, the EPR of C. glacialis increased only in the range of 0–5°C and dropped with further temperature growth. The difference in the influence of temperature on reproduction of these two species is statistically significant. Feeding conditions have a considerable effect on the C. finmarchicus EPR. The EPRs of the female C. glacialis that fed or starved for 5 days displayed no significant difference. These results suggest that the C. finmarchicus EPR increases with temperature under favorable feeding conditions, whereas the C. glacialis EPR decreases at a temperature over 5°C independently of the feeding conditions. This allows for prediction of the shift in abundances of these two species in pelagic communities of Arctic seas in the case of a warming scenario.},

	abstract = {To better understand the feeding and reproductive ecology of euphausiids (krill) in different ocean environments, lipid classes and individual lipid components of four different species of euphausiids from Northeast Pacific (temperate species) and Southern Ocean (Antarctic species) were analyzed in animals from multiple life stages and seasons. The dominant krill species in the Northeast Pacific Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera, were compared to the two major Antarctic species, Euphausia superba and E. crystallorophias. Analysis comprised total lipid and lipid classes together with individual fatty acid and sterol composition in adults, juveniles, and larvae. Antarctic krill had much higher lipid content than their temperate relatives (10–50 and 5–20\% of dry mass for Antarctic and temperate species, respectively) with significant seasonal variations observed. Phospholipids were the dominant lipid class in both temperate krill species, while neutral storage lipids (wax esters and triacylglycerols for E. crystallorophias and E. superba, respectively) were the major lipid class in Antarctic krill and accounted for up to 40\% of the total lipid content. Important fatty acids, specifically 16:0, 18:1ω9, 20:5ω3, and 22:6ω3, were detected in all four krill species, with minor differences between species and seasons. Detailed lipid profiles suggest that krill alter their lipid composition with life stage and season. In particular, larval Antarctic krill appear to utilize alternate food resources (i.e., sea-ice associated organisms) during austral winter in contrast to juveniles and adults (i.e., seston and copepods). Lipid dynamics in krill among krill in both systems appear closely linked to their life cycle and environmental conditions including food availability, and can provide a more complete comparative ecology of euphausiids in these environmentally distinct systems.},

	abstract = {To analyze the mitogenome of the amphipod Onisimus nanseni, we amplified the complete mitogenome of O. nanseni using long-PCR and genome walking techniques. The mitogenome of O. nanseni is circular and contains all the typical mt genes (2 rRNAs, 22 tRNAs, and 13 protein-coding genes). It has two peculiar non-coding regions of 148 bp and 194 bp. The latter can be involved in replication and termination processes. The total length of the pooled protein-coding, rRNA, and tRNA genes is shorter than those of other crustaceans. In addition, the intergenic spacers of the O. nanseni mitogenome are considerably shorter in length than those of other crustaceans. Fourteen adjacent genes overlap, resulting in a compact mitogenomic structure. In the O. nanseni mitogenome, the AT composition is elevated, particularly in the control regions (78.9\% AT), as has been demonstrated for two other amphipods. The tRNA order is highly rearranged compared to other arthropod mitogenomes, but the order of protein-coding genes and rRNAs is largely conserved. The gene cluster between the CO1 and CO3 genes is completely conserved among all amphipods compared. This provides insights into the evolution and gene structures of crustacean mitochondrial genomes, particularly in amphipods.},

Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) has become the benchmark technology for the detection and quantification of nucleic acids in a research, diagnostic, forensic and biotechnology setting. However, ill-assorted pre-assay conditions, poor assay design and inappropriate data analysis methodologies have resulted in the recurrent publication of data that are at best inconsistent and at worst irrelevant and even misleading. Furthermore, there is a lamentable lack of transparency of reporting, with the “Materials and Methods” sections of many publications, especially those with high impact factors, not fit for the purpose of evaluating the quality of any reported qPCR data. This poses a challenge to the integrity of the scientific literature, with serious consequences not just for basic research, but potentially calamitous implications for drug development and disease monitoring. These issues are being addressed by a set of guidelines that propose a minimum standard for the provision of information for qPCR experiments (“MIQE”). MIQE aims to restructure to-day’s free-for-all qPCR methods into a more consistent format that will encourage detailed auditing of experimental detail, data analysis and reporting principles. General implementation of these guidelines is an important requisite for the maturing of qPCR into a robust, accurate and reliable nucleic acid quantification technology.},

Accumulated literature data indicate that this does not relate closely to the actual respiration rate. The new method described here is based on reduction of tetrazolium violet in a homogenate with a natural level of substrates. The analytical protocol ensures that the spectrophotometric reading after 1 h incubation at 40°C reflects the ambient amount of substrates available. This method is superior to the traditional ETS assay in giving a closer correlation with ambient respiration rate. A number of methodological tests have been performed and recommendations are given to optimize the measurements. Macrozooplankton species from the coastal waters of Sweden, representing different taxonomic and trophic groups, showed a range in respiration/ETS ratio from 1.1 to 2.9, and both inter- and intra-specific variability in this ratio were reduced by 50–70\% compared with the traditional ETS assay. Results from other environments and for particulate organic matter indicate a similar general improvement. The new analytical assay is simple, cheap and well suited for fieldwork.},

In this mod-eling approach data sets on the biochemical composition of krill and its food sources are combined into a model that takes food quality into account rather than just food availability during different seasons. Krill is defined in terms of protein, neutral lipid, polar lipid, carbohydrate, chitin, and ash content, and the model tracks krill neutral lipid content separately from weight. The model includes parameterizations of filtration, ingestion, and metabolic processes which determine krill growth rate. Initial ratios of protein, neutral lipid, polar lipid, carbohydrate and ash change in chitin response to the biochemical composition of food as krill grows. Model results show that a diet of phytoplankton food alone may be sufficient for krill to grow to observed sizes but may not be sufficient to provide the summer lipid resources that are observed in the field and that are necessary for krill to reproduce and survive winter. The inclusion of sea ice algae as an additional food is beneficial for krill at the end of winter but does not significantly change summer krill lipid content. However, the amount of lipids accumulated within krill increases significantly when krill feeds on lipid-rich heterotrophic food, which points to the importance of carnivory, even in times when phytoplankton food is available. The strategy of combusting body components to produce energy (shrinking) isfound to provide the greatest source of energy for krill of all sizes during times of prolonged starvation.},

	abstract = {The waxing and waning cycle of the moon is repeated at approximately 1-month intervals, and concomitant changes occur in the levels of moonlight and cueing signals detected by organisms on the earth. In the goldlined spinefoot Siganus guttatus, a spawner lunar-synchronized around the first quarter moon, periodic changes in moonlight are used to cue gonadal development and gamete release. Rearing of mature fish under artificial constant full moon and new moon conditions during the spawning season leads to disruption or delay of synchronous spawning around the predicted moon phase. Melatonin, an endogenous transducer of the environmental light/dark cycle, increases in the blood and in the pineal gland around the new moon period and decreases around the full moon period. In synchrony with melatonin fluctuation, melatonin receptor(s) mRNA abundance is higher during the new moon period than during the full moon. The melatonin/melatonin receptor system is likely affected by moonlight. Measurements of the expression patterns of clock genes in neural tissues demonstrate that Cryptochrome (Cry1 and Cry3) and Period (Per2) fluctuate with lunar periodicity, the former peaking in the medial part of the brain around the first quarter moon period, and the latter peaking in the pineal gland around the full moon. Some clock genes may respond to periodic changes in moon phase and appear to be involved in the generation of lunar-related rhythmicity in lunar spawners. Thus, some fish use moonlight-related periodicities as reliable information for synchronizing the timing of reproductive events.},

	abstract = {In modern fish feeds, the protein sources consist of denaturated finely ground ingredients. From the literature, it has been reported that use of coarsely chopped, but not denaturated, fish as the dietary protein source gave better growth performance and protein utilisation. Growth, feed utilisation and protein turnover using two different fish meal particle sizes (micro- or coarse-grounded) at three dietary protein concentrations (30\%, 35\%, and 45\%) were studied in individually tagged Atlantic salmon in a 3-month growth experiment. At the end of the experimental period, 14C-l-lysine was injected intraperitonally and dorsal muscle samples were taken at 2- and 4-h post-injection. Incorporation of 14C-l-lysine into muscle protein, RNA, DNA and water soluble protein was analysed from samples of muscle tissue. Only small effects on growth rate, feed conversion rate, protein and energy retention, and nitrogen and fat digestion were found. During the growth experiment, large individual variations in growth rates were observed, which did not correlate to the initial body weight. The total RNA content expressed as RNA amount per unit of DNA (RNA:DNA ratio) did not reflect the specific RNA activity, and individual growth rate was not correlated to the specific RNA activity or RNA:DNA ratio and only poorly to the relative incorporation rate of amino acids. Growth rate was, however, correlated to the relative efficiency of protein synthesis. The results indicate that the protein catabolism is more important for net protein deposition and growth than protein anabolism.},

How krill adapt to these conditions has yet to be determined, and it was the purpose of this study to gain more insight by investigating the differences between summer and winter krill populations at the molecular level. To achieve this, we used a cDNA microarray to compare gene expression between female adult krill caught during summer and winter near the Antarctic Peninsula (60°S), and between Peninsula krill and krill caught near South Georgia (54°S) during the same winter. The Peninsula seasonal comparison showed up-regulation in summer krill of genes involved in feeding and digestion, respiration, motor activity and immunity. Summer krill also showed evidence of increased vitellogenesis, with an insulin-related peptide up-regulated and neuroparsin down-regulated. The comparison between the different overwintering locations showed an up-regulation in the South Georgia krill of genes involved in feeding and digestion, and immunity. There was, however, no differential expression of genes involved in respiration, motor activity or vitellogenesis, suggesting that despite the above differences, both populations of overwintering krill were in a quiescent state. This study shows how krill physiology changes seasonally at the molecular level and how these changes are flexible according to the overwintering environment.},

The proportion of spawners, latency period, spawning rate, fecundity, spawning interval and number of days spent at stage IV per spawn were not significantly different (P\&gt;0.05) among the three light intensity treatments. Compared to dim light, bright light did not adversely affect the maturation and reproductive performance of ablated prawns. However, the percentage of spawning at stage III (31.6\%) and mortality (26.7\%) were significantly higher in the DARK treatment (P\&lt;0.05). A trend of increasing fecundity with an increase in light intensity was observed. Also, the hypothesis of whether the prawn eye is the only light receptor involved in ovarian maturation and spawning was tested by covering the remaining eye of ablated prawns with prepared caps made from black heat-shrinkable tubing (polyolefin). These prawns were held under 1100 lux (BRI-COV treatment) and 2 lux (DIM-COV) with the DARK treatment as the control group. The proportion of spawners was lowest in the BRI-COV treatment and highest in the DARK treatment (P\&lt;0.05), whereas there was no significant difference between these two treatments and the DIM-COV treatment. The DARK treatment, however, had a significantly higher spawning rate (P\&lt;0.05). The significantly higher percentage of spawning at stage III and less time spent at stage IV per spawn of prawns in the DARK treatment (P\&lt;0.05) compared with the DIM-COV and BRI-COV treatments suggest that the prawn eye may not be the only light receptor involving in ovarian maturation and spawning in P. merguiensis.},

	abstract = {The Southern Ocean is ofren portrayed as rhe last great wilderness. However, the marine living resources of the sub-Antarctic islands haw
been harvested for over two centuries. ExploitaLion began with the upper trophic levels and the high-value air-breathing species, before
progressing down the food chain to the lower trophic levels and the less valuable nekton and zooplankton. Exploitation in the sub-Antarctic
began in the late eighteenth century, nowhere better typified than at South Georgia. At South Georgia exploitation started with Antarctic
Fur Seals,Arctocephalus gazella,  which were reduced almost to extinction by the mid-nineteenth century. As the fur trade rapidly became
uneconomic, new targets were sought and by the end of the nineteenth century, oilers were hunting for Southern Elephant Seals, Mirounga leonina, Southern Right Whales, Eubalaena australis, and some sub-Antarctic penguin species. As these stocks also declined and their commercial
exploitation became uneconomic, the focus shifted such that by the beginning of the twentieth century, harvesting for other baleen
whales (the so-called rorquals) and Sperm Whales,Physeter macroephalus, was well-established. With the demise of the great whales, other
less valuable species were then sought, so that by the latter half of the twentieth century, fishing for finfish and krill had begun. Removal of
the upper trophic level species has impacted upon the sub-Antarctic marine system resulting in profound changes, the consequences of which
continue to the present. The consequences of such harvesting are reviewed in the context of an ecosystem model that demonstrates some
of the expected changes in the marine foodweb that may arise as a consequence of harvesting and how, once harvesting ceases, populations
may recover to their pre-exploitation state.The current status of the South Georgia foodweb is reviewed in the context of these predicted
changes. In the period since uncontrolled harvesting ceased, the role of physical environmental forcing factors has been recognised and
found to be key to any understanding of marine foodweb dynamics. These two major forces, historical exploitation and climate change,
may act in concert to alter ecosystem dynamics. Disentangling these confounding drivers may be difficult and complex, but because of the
relatively well-documented history of exploitation the sub-Antarctic may offer one location where it is feasible.},

	abstract = {Krill (Euphausia superba) provide a direct link between primary producers and higher trophic levels in the Antarctic marine food web. The pelagic tunicate Salpa thompsoni can also be important during spring and summer through the formation of extensive and dense blooms. Although salps are not a major dietary item for Antarctic vertebrate predators,, their blooms can affect adult krill reproduction and survival of krill larvae. Here we provide data from 1995 and 1996 that support hypothesized relationships between krill, salps and region-wide sea-ice conditions,. We have assessed salp consumption as a proportion of net primary production, and found correlations between herbivore densities and integrated chlorophyll-a that indicate that there is a degree of competition between krill and salps. Our analysis of the relationship between annual sea-ice cover and a longer time series of air temperature measurements, indicates a decreased frequency of winters with extensive sea-ice development over the last five decades. Our data suggest that decreased krill availability may affect the levels of their vertebrate predators. Regional warming and reduced krill abundance therefore affect the marine food web and krill resource management.},

	abstract = {During the Circumpolar Flaw Lead System Study (CFL, 2007–2008), large aggregations of polar cod were detected in winter in the Amundsen Gulf (Western Canadian Arctic) using the EK60 echosounder of the CCGS Amundsen research icebreaker. Biomass estimated over 10 months reached a maximum of 0.732 kg m−2 in February. Aggregations were encountered only in the presence of an ice cover from December to April. The vertical extent of the aggregations was dictated by temperature and zooplankton prey distribution. In winter, polar cod generally occupied the relatively warm deep Atlantic Layer ({\textgreater}0°C), but a fraction of the densest aggregations occasionally followed zooplankton prey up into the cold Pacific Halocline (−1.6 to 0°C). The diel vertical migration of polar cod was precisely synchronized with the seasonally increasing photoperiod. Throughout winter, polar cod aggregations migrated to progressively deeper regions (from 220 to 550 m bottom depths) in response to increasing light intensity, presumably to avoid predation by visual predators such as the ringed seal. Comparing Amundsen Gulf and Franklin Bay indicates that the entrapment of polar cod in embayments during winter is an important mechanism to provide marine mammal predators with dense concentrations of their main prey within their diving range.},

Although the observations are still limited, females showed oscillations in MF that seem to parallel the vitellogenic cycle.

	abstract = {Copepods of the genus Tigriopus have been proposed as marine models for investigations of environmental perturbation. One rapidly increasing anthropogenic stressor for intertidal organisms is light pollution. Given the sensitivity of circadian rhythms to exogenous light, the genes/proteins of a Tigriopus circadian pacemaker represent a potential system for investigating the influences of artificial light sources on circadian behavior in an intertidal species. Here, the molecular components of a putative Tigriopus californicus circadian clock were identified using publicly accessible transcriptome data; the recently deduced circadian proteins of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus were used as a reference. Transcripts encoding homologs of all commonly recognized ancestral arthropod core clock proteins were identified (i.e. CLOCK, CRYPTOCHROME 2, CYCLE, PERIOD and TIMELESS), as were ones encoding proteins likely to modulate the core clock (i.e. CASEIN KINASE II, CLOCKWORK ORANGE, DOUBLETIME, PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 1, PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2A, SHAGGY, SUPERNUMERARY LIMBS and VRILLE) or to act as inputs to it (i.e. CRYPTOCHROME 1). PAR DOMAIN PROTEIN 1 was the only circadian-associated protein not identified in Tigriopus; it appears absent in Calanus too. These data represent just the third full set of molecular components for a crustacean circadian pacemaker (Daphnia pulex and C. finmarchicus previously), and only the second obtained from transcribed sequences (C. finmarchicus previously). Given Tigriopus' proposed status as a model for investigating the influences of anthropogenic stressors in the marine environment, these data provide the first suite of gene/protein targets for understanding how light pollution may influence circadian physiology and behavior in an intertidal organism.},

Levels of the clock protein FRQ were measured inNeurospora at various temperatures; at higher temperatures, the amount of FRQ oscillated around higher levels.

Moderate temperature changes could dominate light-to-dark shifts in the influence of circadian timing. Temperature regulation of clock components could explain temperature resetting of rhythms and how single transitions can initiate rhythmicity from characteristic circadian phases.},

	abstract = {A continuous, high-resolution time series of zooplankton and hydrographic data were collected from Kongsfjorden between April and September 2002 using a sediment trap and instrumentation deployed on a mooring. The time series has, for the first time, demonstrated the close relationship between water mass advection and changes in zooplankton community structure in Kongsfjorden. Zooplankton identified in the trap samples included 31 species/genera and seven higher taxa representing ubiquitous, boreal and Arctic biogeographic origins. Correspondence Analysis (CA) identified three phases of zooplankton community composition in 2002. Phase I, from 18 April to 29 May, consisted primarily of resident Calanus finmarchicus and Calanus glacialis stage CVI females. Phase II, from 30 May to 23 June, was dominated by meroplankton, Oikopleura cf. vanhoeffeni, C. finmarchicus early life stages (CI to CIII), Calanus hyperboreus and Themisto abyssorum. Phase III, from 4 July to 8 September, comprised C. finmarchicus (predominantly CV), C. glacialis CV, C. hyperboreus CIV and a greater diversity of other copepod species, in particular, increasing numbers of Oithona similis. Transition between the zooplankton community phases was abrupt and clearly associated with the advection of water masses into the fjord from the adjacent shelf. Peaks of the Arctic species C. glacialis, C. hyperboreus and T. abyssorum in late May were associated with a change in the dominant fjordic water mass from local Winter Cooled Water (WCW) to an influx of Arctic Water (ArW) from the coastal current. A temperature increase of 2.75 °C in the upper water column signified the transition from Phase II to Phase III with the dominant water mass changing from ArW to Atlantic Water (AW) from the West Spitsbergen Current.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Eukaryotic cells have evolved various response mechanisms to counteract the deleterious consequences of oxidative stress. Among these processes, metabolic alterations seem to play an important role. RESULTS: We recently discovered that yeast cells with reduced activity of the key glycolytic enzyme triosephosphate isomerase exhibit an increased resistance to the thiol-oxidizing reagent diamide. Here we show that this phenotype is conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans and that the underlying mechanism is based on a redirection of the metabolic flux from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway, altering the redox equilibrium of the cytoplasmic NADP(H) pool. Remarkably, another key glycolytic enzyme, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), is known to be inactivated in response to various oxidant treatments, and we show that this provokes a similar redirection of the metabolic flux. CONCLUSION: The naturally occurring inactivation of GAPDH functions as a metabolic switch for rerouting the carbohydrate flux to counteract oxidative stress. As a consequence, altering the homoeostasis of cytoplasmic metabolites is a fundamental mechanism for balancing the redox state of eukaryotic cells under stress conditions},

	abstract = {In this paper we consider the results of three mesoscale surveys covering a wide area of krill distribution between the Antarctic Peninsula and South Georgia Island. Surveys including from 158 to 202 stations were carried out by Soviet research vessels in the summer-autumn periods of 1983/84 and 1987/88 and in the spring-summer of 1984/85 using a grid of stations according to the standard method for Isaacs-Kidd midwater trawls operating in the layer 0 to 100 m. Overall krill biomass distribution (g/1 000 m3) and its mean values were analysed by subarea (Subareas 48.1, 48.2 and 48.3) and for the whole study area. Survey results confirm current understanding of the general pattern of krill distribution and drift in the western part of the Atlantic sector of the Antarctic (e.g. Priddle et al., 1988; Makarov, 1996). The greatest degree of spatial-temporal stability in the krill distribution field with high biomass of aggregations was observed in the western part of the area stretching from the Antarctic Peninsula to the eastern part of the South Orkneys area. The greatest variability of krill distribution on the spatial-temporal scale of the survey, which is characterised by a change in biomass of more than two orders of magnitude in different seasons, was observed in the South Georgia region and the adjacent waters of the Scotia Sea (Subarea 48.3). The possibility of krill transportation into the South Georgia region is considered. It is shown that the absence of krill in the island region during the 1983/84 season was caused exclusively by unfavourable oceanological conditions (lack of water flow from southern areas). It is also demonstrated that the absence of krill in the eastern part of the Scotia Sea may cause it to be absent from the South Georgia region regardless of oceanological conditions (spring-summer period 1984/85). The possibility of recruitment of the krill stock to the South Georgia region from the central part of the Scotia Sea is considered. Analysis of variability of mean biomass by area and season indicates that patterns of krill abundance and biomass recently observed in Subarea 48.1 (Siegel et al., 1997, 1998) are not representative of the survey area as a whole. The total biomass index in the study area during all seasons remained at a constant level (76.5-101.7 g/1 000 m3).},

	abstract = {Metabolic rates and elemental and biochemical composition of Furcilia IV (FIV) larvae of Euphausia superba were studied during 12 d of starvation at the onset of winter in the Bellings- hausen Sea. This time of the year may be a critical period in the krill life cycle because their larvae must switch from feeding on summer phytoplankton blooms to winter ice algae. FIV utilized mainly lipids overall, but also protein during the second half of the 12 d period. After 6 d of starvation most of the larvae lost half of their body C. Body lipid content decreased from 12.7 to 1.5\% of dry mass (DM), whereas protein fell from 32.7 to 25.8\% of DM. Respiration rates decreased from 1.3 to 0.70.8 l O2 (mg DM)1 h1 in the first 3 d, after which they remained roughly constant. These rates correspond to C losses of 2.7 and 2.0\% body C d1 respectively. Excretion rates decreased from 0.04 to 0.02 g NH4 (mg DM)1 h1 until the middle of the starvation period and then rose to 0.05 g NH4 (mg DM)1 h1 by the end, which is probably related to the increase in protein breakdown. Based on these losses of body C and lipid, the FIV larvae may pass their point of no return, where they lose their ability to recover from nutritional stress, after 6 d.},

	abstract = {Although the Bradford protein estimation assay has found wide distribution, it has a number of drawbacks, which in some cases have been shown to produce erroneous results upon comparison to other, more precise, methods for protein estimation. It was found that the underestimation of the protein content of membrane-containing fractions cannot be overcome by pretreatment with NaOH or the detergents employed (Triton X-100, sodium dodecyl sulfate, 3[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]propanesulfonic acid) and the protein estimates obtained do not agree with estimates obtained by the Lowry assay. Upon storage of fractions at -20 degrees C there is a considerable loss of dye binding activity, varying in accordance with the membrane content of the fractions, reaching up to 58\% in the case of membrane-enriched fractions stored at -20 degrees C for 15 days. Pretreatment with the employed agents brought about an equal increase of dye binding capacity, specific for the individual fractions; however, none of these agents could recover the dye binding activity lost during several days of storage at -20 degrees C. It is suggested that the straightforward Bradford procedure has a rather limited scope of application, particularly concerning membrane-containing samples, and requires preliminary studies to determine its applicability according to the nature of the biological material examined.},

Timing of ovarian maturation, the percent of the population reproducing, and individual reproductive output (batch volume, embryo diameter) were measured. Indices have been developed to quantify the timing and intensity of reproduction in Antarctic krill. One finding important to estimates of population fecundity for this long-lived species is that the percent of the population reproducing can vary widely, from 10 to 98\%. Each season was characterized as having delayed, average or advanced ovarian development. In this study we relate these indices to direct and indirect indicators of spring or annual food availability. The timing of the spring sea ice retreat and the extent of sea ice in the spring (September through November) appear to significantly affect the intensity and timing of reproduction in the population. Intensity of reproduction was highest under average conditions, and oöcyte development fastest with conditions of a late retreat and high spring sea ice extent.},

Interannual changes in zooplankton on the West Spitsbergen Shelf in relation to hydrography and their consequences for the diet of planktivorous seabirds. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 69: 890–901. The purpose of the work was to determine how atmospheric and oceanic processes (the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Arctic Ocean Oscillation (AOO)) influence hydrography and zooplankton on the West Spitsbergen Shelf (WSS), and the impacts of the processes on chick meals of zooplanktivorous little auks Alle alle. There were distinct Atlantic and Arctic oceanographic domains on the shelf resulting from the presence of the West Spitsbergen Current and the Sørkapp Current, which contain different proportions of Calanus finmarchicus and C. glacialis. The abundance of warm- and cold-water species varied as a result of an interplay between processes in the atmosphere and ocean. In the Arctic domain, on which the study focused, the NAO impacted oceanography, zooplankton, and consequently little auk chick meals, with time-lags of 4–7 years. The diet of little auk chicks was more energy-rich when C. glacialis stage 5 in the Arctic community were more easily available. To date, the changes in zooplankton abundance on the WSS have not posed a threat to the ability of little auks to feed their chicks lipid-rich Arctic copepods.},

	abstract = {The objectives of the present study were to characterize the changes in the proximate chemical composition, lipid classes, fatty-acid profiles, glycogen and cholesterol contents of the muscle, ovary and hepatopancreas of Nephrops norvegicus (L.), during the reproduction cycle of this species. The gonadosomatic index increased significantly in May and June and during maturation, suggesting that spawning may start in late spring or summer. The hepatosomatic index also increased throughout the ovarian maturation, suggesting that the hepatopancreatic resources are not depleted. Positive correlations between lipid levels in the ovary and the gonadosomatic index (r=0.51, P{\textless}0.05) and the hepatopsomatic index (r=0.27, P{\textless}0.05) were found. In fact, ovarian lipid levels increased with maturation, but no concomitant decrease occurred in hepatopancreatic lipids. The muscle showed very low lipid levels (mainly polar lipids), presenting a significant increase during May and June (P{\textless}0.05). Higher proportions of neutral lipids, mainly triacylglycerols, were observed in the ovary and the hepatopancreas. Since both ovarian and hepatopancreatic cholesterol increased with maturation, the mobilization of hepatopancreatic cholesterol stores to build up ovarian cholesterol was not clear. On the other hand, protein and glycogen contents in the muscle, ovary and hepatopancreas did not vary as a function of ovary maturity stage. Among the various tissues analysed, the glycogen was mainly stored in the hepatopancreas and to a lesser extent in the muscle. In both ovary and hepatopancreas the major fatty acids were 16:0, 18:1(n–7), 18:1(n–9), 20:5(n–3) and 22:6(n–3), and significant increases (P{\textless}0.05) in the levels of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids were observed in the ovary during sexual maturation, which indicates these compounds are the major sources of energy during embryonic and early larval development. It was evident that reproduction has profound effects upon the biochemistry of this species, because there are large associated energy costs, owing to the increase in biosynthetic work, which will support the lecithotrophic strategy of the embryos and first larval stages.},

	abstract = {Circadian clocksubiquitous in life forms ranging from bacteria to multicellular organismsoften exhibit intrinsic temperature compensation; the period of circadian oscillators is maintained constant over a range of physiological temperatures, despite the expected Arrhenius form for the reaction coefficient. Observations have shown that the amplitude of the oscillation depends on the temperature but the period does not; this suggests that although not every reaction step is temperature independent, the total system comprising several reactions still exhibits compensation. Here we present a general mechanism for such temperature compensation. Consider a system with multiple activation energy barriers for reactions, with a common enzyme shared across several reaction steps. The steps with the highest activation energy rate-limit the cycle when the temperature is not high. If the total abundance of the enzyme is limited, the amount of free enzyme available to catalyze a specific reaction decreases as more substrates bind to the common enzyme. We show that this change in free enzyme abundance compensates for the Arrhenius-type temperature dependence of the reaction coefficient. Taking the example of circadian clocks with cyanobacterial proteins KaiABC, consisting of several phosphorylation sites, we show that this temperature compensation mechanism is indeed valid. Specifically, if the activation energy for phosphorylation is larger than that for dephosphorylation, competition for KaiA shared among the phosphorylation reactions leads to temperature compensation. Moreover, taking a simpler model, we demonstrate the generality of the proposed compensation mechanism, suggesting relevance not only to circadian clocks but to other (bio)chemical oscillators as well.},

Eugregarines were observed to accumulate in the front section of the gut at any host maturity stage. The results of statistical analysis showed that eugregarines at immediately pre-molt stage of the krill decreased significantly in the posterior of the hind-gut, and increased in the anterior of the hind-gut. Thus, the krill's molt stage may be one factor affecting the spatial distribution of eugregarines. As a strategy for avoiding discharge to the outer environment by molting, eugregarines may move to a safety zone (mid-gut).},

Development rates were equiproportional, but not isochronal. Naupliar stage durations were similar, except for non-feeding stages, which were of short duration, and the first feeding stage, which was prolonged, while copepodite stage durations increased with increasing stage of development. Under limiting food concentrations at 8°C, development rates were prolonged but similar relative patterns in stage durations were observed. Body size (length and weight) was inversely related to temperature and positively related to food concentration. Condition measurements were not affected by temperature, but were positively related to food concentration. Growth rates increased with increasing temperature and increased asymptotically with increasing food concentration. At high food concentrations, growth rates of naupliar stages were high (except for individuals molting from the final naupliar stage to the first copepodite stage, in which growth rates were depressed), while growth of copepodites decreased with increasing stage of development. Neither nitrogen nor carbon growth rates, the former a proxy for structural growth, were exponential over the entire life cycle, but rather sigmoidal. Carbon-specific growth rates were greater than nitrogen-specific growth rates, and this difference increased with increasing stage of development, reflecting an augmentation in lipid deposition in the older stages. However, nitrogen and carbon growth rates were more similar under food-limited conditions. Based on this study, we recommend that secondary production rates of Calanus finmarchicus and possibly other lipid-storing copepods not be estimated from egg production measurements alone, as has been suggested for other species of copepods, because growth, including structural growth, is not equivalent for all stages.},

Measurements made in Antarctic Circumpolar Current water were compared with others made in Weddell Sea water, and profiles from shelf, shelf-slope and oceanic sites were considered separately. In summer, Weddell Sea surface water was significantly colder than that of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (1.66 and 2.59C, respectively), but no changes of temperature corresponded with bathymetry. There were no systematic differences between the salinity measurements made in Weddell Sea surface water and those in Antarctic Circumpolar Current water; however, oceanic waters were always more saline than those over the shelf-slope and shelf (33.91. 33.89 and 33.86, respectively). Silicate levels correlated well with seawater temperature, and Weddell Sea surface water concentrations were substantially higher than those of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (51 and 25 mmol rne3\_ respectively. in winter; 29 and 13mmolm-3 in summer). No such differences were found for phosphate or nitrate, and no systematic differences in any of the nutrient levels were attributable to bathymetry. Although summer chlorophyll a levels appeared to be highest in Antarctic Circumpolar Current water over the shelf and shelf-slope (2.7- 3.0mg mw3), no significant differences were attributable to water-mass or bathymetry. A clear seasonal pattern was evident, with the warmest seawater conditions, minimum nutrient concentrations and highest chlorophyll a levels found between December and March. Phosphate and nitrate were never exhausted: the lowest recorded phosphate concentrations were around 0.6 mmol m- and for nitrate 11 mmolm-. (5 l.0mmolm-3) were evident during some summer surveys from the 1920s through to the present day. Average nutrient deficits calculated either between winter and summer mixed-layer concentrations, or between summer mixed-layer and T,i, values. produced similar estimates of carbon fixation for both phosphate and silicate, while nitrate appeared to underestimate carbon production. Phosphate and silicate deficits were considered to be satisfactory predictors of carbon production, which was about 30-40 g C mm2 year- m a mixed-layer depth of 50 m. Considerable interannual variability was found, with winter-like conditions prevailing until January on some occasions, and apparent year-to-year variability in the timing and magnitude of nutrient utilisation (especially silicate) by phytoplankton. A relationship was found between sea surface conditions around South Georgia in summer and the preceding winters fast-ice duration at the South Orkney Islands, which implied that some of this variability was attributable to large-scale change over the Scotia Sea as a whole, as opposed to local influences.},

This dramatic recovery and collapse is the second cycle this century, and constitutes part of a long-term structural change in a pelagic fish community. The new cycle was initiated with higher survival at the earliest stages of sardine on both coasts of central Japan and they spread to the north, south and offshore. Strong year classes were produced at short intervals. The spawning area moved westward and inshore. Collapse was caused by survival failure. The spawning activity shifted to theeast and offshore and the range of the sardine was reduced. Recovery was triggered by global climatic change in a density-independent manner and the collapse underway is caused by a density-dependent mechanism. The sardine is the keystone species in the pelagic fish community and changes of mackerel (Scomber japonicus) and anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) populations are in progress.},

	abstract = {Resolving the spatial variability in the population structure of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) requires a synoptic sample, as in the design of the CCAMLR 2000 Survey. However, this approach is not appropriate for assessing temporal variability. The size of krill in the diet of Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) has been shown to provide a good representation of the temporal changes in the krill population structure from within their foraging area. At Cape Shirreff, South Shetland Islands, krill in nets had modal size classes of 46–48 mm and 52–54 mm in length and appeared to reflect the presence of larger krill offshore and smaller krill inshore; krill in the diet of fur seals contained both modes, indicating that the foraging area of fur seals integrated the spatial variability in the krill population. At Signy Island, South Orkney Islands, krill in nets and fur seal diets had a modal size class of 52 mm when sampled simultaneously; however, krill in the diet of seals showed a decline in size later in the season with an overall mode of 48 mm. At Bird Island, South Georgia, there was little overlap between net samples, with a modal size class of 30–40 mm, and fur seal diets, with distinct modes of 44 and 54 mm; and there was also much greater spatial variability in the size of krill in these net samples than in those from the other two locations. Extending the comparison of krill size in the diet of seals, to include spatially congruent net samples collected immediately prior to the CCAMLR 2000 Survey, showed almost complete overlap and indicated an even greater spatial variability in the krill population structure at South Georgia. Interactions between the oceanographic transport and enhanced growth rates of krill at South Georgia may combine to produce a higher degree of spatial variability in the krill population compared to other locations and this may limit the use of differences in krill length as an indicator of their provenance. This study underlines the importance of using data from multiple sources when considering large-scale krill population dynamics; information that is crucial to the effective management of the commercial exploitation of krill.},

Furcilia stage III (FIII) larvae were most abundant, so only these were used for all analyses (dry mass [DM], elemental and biochemical composition, gut content) and experiments (metabolic and ingestion rates, selective feeding behavior). Chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations in the mixed layer were {\textless}0.1 g L-1.

Their atomic O : N ratio of 72 indicated that lipids were the main metabolic substrate of FIII larvae in the field. The daily C ration ranged from 0.4\% at the lowest food concentration of 3 g C L-1 to 28\% at the highest enriched food concentration of 216 g C L-1, whereas clearance rates decreased with increasing food concentrations. In natural seawater, 115 ml mg-1 C h-1, and in natural seawater enriched with ice biota, 24 ml mg-1 C h-1, the clearance rates on specific phytoplankton taxa revealed no significant difference across a food size range of 12-220 m. The study suggests that during periods of low food supply in the water column, larvae have to exploit ice biota to cover their metabolic demands.},

The phylogenetic reconstructions indicated that the Antarctic species form a monophyletic clade separated by the non-Antarctic species. The results revealed a large genetic divergence between the Antarctic (E. superba and E. crystallorophias) and sub-Antarctic species (E. vallentini). The time of separation between these species, estimated from the molecular data, is around 20 million years ago, which is comparable with the geological time of the formation of a circum-Antarctic water circulation and the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone. The euphausiid molecular phylogeny therefore represents evidence for vicariant speciation.},

Consistent with the hypothesis, hatching started as early as January and extended to July in seas receiving large river discharge (Laptev/East Siberian Seas, Hudson Bay, and Beaufort Sea). By contrast, hatching was restricted to April–July in regions with little freshwater input (Canadian Archipelago, North Baffin Bay, and Northeast Water). Length (weight) in late-summer (14 August) varied from \&lt;10 mm (\&lt;0.01 g) in July hatchers to 50 mm (0.91 g) in January hatchers. An earlier ice break-up, more frequent winter polynyas, a warmer surface layer, and increased river discharge linked to climate warming could enhance the survival of juvenile 0+ polar cod by enabling a larger fraction of the annual cohort to hatch earlier and reach a larger size before the fall migration to the deep overwintering grounds. A further test of the hypothesis would require the verification that the early winter hatching of polar cod actually occurs in the thermal refuge provided by under-ice river plumes.},

	abstract = {Calanus finmarchicus relies on dormancy to thrive in the seasonal environment of the boreal Atlantic. The lipid accumulation window (LAW) hypothesis proposes that a seasonal window of environmental conditions allows developing individuals to store enough lipids for dormancy to be safely initiated. Successful dormancy requires a sufficient amount of lipids to fulfil the reduced metabolic demand of the dormant individual and to sustain the final maturation process. We used a pattern-oriented modelling approach that implements the LAW hypothesis and employs a genetic algorithm for parameter estimation, in order to reproduce the observed phenology and demography of C. finmarchicus populations from the two contrasting regions, the Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL) and the Gulf of Maine (GoM) in the northwest Atlantic shelf. In the GSL, the model reproduced the timing of dormancy, the abundance and individual condition of late copepodid stages. In the GoM, the model produced a semi-annual dormancy pattern, as no locally produced individual could last the 6–8 months of dormancy inferred from the available observations. Further testing requires extending demographic time series, including lipid condition of late copepodid stages in the GoM, and the implementation of a 3-D modelling framework that would explicitly address the complex interactions between circulation and population dynamics of C. finmarchicus over the entire northwest Atlantic shelf.},

	abstract = {Time series of sea ice draft in the Weddell Sea are evaluated together with hydrographic observations, satellite passive microwave data, and ice drift for estimation of the freshwater fluxes into and out of the Weddell Sea. Ice draft is measured with moored upward looking sonars since 1990 along two transects across the Weddell Gyre. One transect, extending from the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula to Kapp Norvegia, was sampled between 1990 and 1994 and covers the flow into and out of the southern Weddell Sea. The other transect, sampled since 1996 and extending from the Antarctic continent northward along the Greenwich meridian, covers the exchange of water masses between the eastern and the western Weddell Sea. In order to relate results obtained during the different time periods, empirical relationships are established between the length of the sea ice season, derived from the satellite passive microwave data and defined as the number of days per year with the sea ice concentration exceeding 15\%, and (1) the annual mean ice draft and (2) the annual mean ice volume transport. By using these empirical relationships, estimates of annual mean ice drafts and ice volume transports are derived at all mooring sites for the period February 1979 through February 1999. Wind and current force a westward ice transport in the coastal areas of the eastern Weddell Sea and a northward ice transport in the west. During the 2-year period 1991/1992 the mean ice volume export from the Weddell Sea is (50 ± 19) × 103 m3 s−1. This freshwater export is representative for a longer-term (20-year) mean and exceeds the average amount of freshwater gained by precipitation and ice shelf melt by about 19×103 m3 s−1, yielding an upper bound for the formation rate of newly ventilated bottom water in the Weddell Sea of 2.6 Sv.},

Simulated losses are moderate ({\textless}0.25 mm per year at sea level) over the 21st century but generally increase thereafter. Except possibly for the lowest-melt scenario, the simulations indicate that early-stage collapse has begun. Less certain is the time scale, with the onset of rapid ({\textgreater}1 mm per year of sea-level rise) collapse in the different simulations within the range of 200 to 900 years.},

However, because the fate of bloom biomass could not be adequately resolved in these experiments, the timescales of carbon sequestration from the atmosphere are uncertain. Here we report the results of a five-week experiment carried out in the closed core of a vertically coherent, mesoscale eddy of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, during which we tracked sinking particles from the surface to the deep-sea floor. A large diatom bloom peaked in the fourth week after fertilization. This was followed by mass mortality of several diatom species that formed rapidly sinking, mucilaginous aggregates of entangled cells and chains. Taken together, multiple lines of evidence-although each with important uncertainties-lead us to conclude that at least half the bloom biomass sank far below a depth of 1,000 metres and that a substantial portion is likely to have reached the sea floor. Thus, iron-fertilized diatom blooms may sequester carbon for timescales of centuries in ocean bottom water and for longer in the sediments.},

	abstract = {Research on the diet and feeding of krill can broadly be divided into three main approaches. a) Investigations of the feeding apparatus, including anatomy and hydrodynamics. b) Grazing experiments. c) Investigation of gut contents and faecal material. Studies on the feeding apparatus indicate that E. superba is able to ingest food particles spanning a wide size range, including nanoplanktonic organisms (2-20μm in diameter). Organisms of this size are known to comparise a large proportion of the phytoplankton of the Southern Ocean throughout the year and represent an important potential food stock available for krill. The main components of the nanoplankton are diatoms and flagellates. Whilst most small diatoms can be identified by optical microscopy, flagellates are fragile and readily disrupted. They are difficult, if not impossible, to identify by optical microscopy in gut and faecal material. To better understand the diet and feeding preferences of krill we are undertaking electron microscopical analysis of the gut contents and faeces of wild krill. Further, we have been feeding various species of flagellates to krill in laboratory culture to investigate which structures survive digestion. These studies have shown that the organic external scales of the prasinophyte Pyramimonas gelidicola and the scales and thread-like material produced by the prymnesiophyte Phaeocystis pouchetii are not digested by E. superba. These have been found in gut and faecal material of wild krill. Large numbers of nanoplanktonic organisms occur in gut and faecal material from krill. The small diatom Nitzschia curta is especially abundant. Choanoflagellates and lightly silicified diatoms including Dactyliosolen antarcticus also occur. These studies support morphological evidence that krill feed extensively on nanoplanktonic organisms.},

	abstract = {The geographic remoteness, the lack of remote sensing capabilities, and the lack of appropriate environmental sensors make the detection of seasonal trends or inter-annual variations in sea-ice microbial biomass or production processes within the pack ice of the Antarctic extremely rare. The evaluation of their inter-annual variability in the context of ice dynamics and trends in regional climate has not been possible. During the late winters of 2001 (July–August) and 2002 (August–September) we assessed sea-ice dynamics, sea-ice characteristics, and biomass of sea-ice microbiota along the Western Antarctic Peninsula. These two winters were marked by large contrasts in the dates of initial ice formation (late June in 2001 and April in 2002), which resulted in differences in the physical pack-ice characteristics. Chlorophyll a (chl a) content in ice cores differed between the study years, with 2002 having 10-fold higher chl a content. The difference in ice-core chl a content is best explained by the timing of ice formation that leads to less phytoplankton scavenging from the water column and a lack of transfer of solar energy into the pack-ice ecosystem. Such a tractable atmosphere ocean–ice–biota coupling may help in evaluating underlying processes responsible for long-term trends in recruitment cycles of upper trophic levels as well as future projections on the response of the Antarctic marine ecosystems to variability in local climate.},

	abstract = {An efficient RNA-extraction method is crucial for transcriptomic studies of ecologically important organisms like copepods. In this study, we used the copepod Acartia hudsonica as a test species to evaluate existing methods, and formulated several improved protocols to consistently and efficiently isolate high-quality RNA from both pooled and individual copepod samples. Our protocols recommend copepod preservation in a phenol/guanidine thiocyanate reagent, followed by bead-beating or micropestle homogenization. To obtain high-quality RNA from pooled samples, one initial chloroform extraction followed by multiple phenol/chloroform extractions are needed before the raw RNA samples are further purified with the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit. When analyzing individual samples, one chloroform extraction followed by purification using the Zymo Research Direct-zol™ MiniPrep Kit gives the best results. Using these protocols, we isolated RNA from pooled and individual A. hudsonica samples with consistent recovery rate (individual samples: 95 ± 12 ng/male; 272 ± 57 ng/female). The cDNAs synthesized using these RNAs were proven to be of high quality by successful amplification of transcripts including the \&gt; 7 kb alpha subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel gene (SCG). For individual A. hudsonica samples, our protocols yielded significantly higher success rates (95\%, n = 456) in reverse transcription quantitative PCR of SCG compared to existing methods (0–85\%, n = 150). Applications of these protocols to nine other copepod species from seven families have led us to achieve high-quality RNAs and cDNAs from pooled and/or individual samples. As a result of testing the protocols, we obtained cDNA sequences of various genes in ten copepod species, some of which are the first record in copepods. Our protocols can easily be adopted by laboratories to facilitate molecular work on copepods.},

	abstract = {Antarctic krill Euphausia superba(here-after krill) occur in regions undergoing rapid envi-ronmental change, particularly loss of winter sea ice.During recent years, harvesting of krill has in -creased, possibly enhancing stress on krill and Antarctic ecosystems. Here we review the overall impact of climate change on krill and Antarctic eco-systems, discuss implications for an ecosystem-based fisheries management approach and identify critical knowledge gaps. Sea ice decline, ocean warming and other environmental stressors act in concert to modify the abundance, distribution and life cycle of krill. Although some of these changes can have posi-tive effects on krill, their cumulative impact is most likely negative. Recruitment, driven largely by the winter survival of larval krill, is probably the popula-tion parameter most susceptible to climate change. Predicting changes to krill populations is urgent, because they will seriously impact Antarctic eco -systems. Such predictions, however, are complicated by an intense inter-annual variability in recruitment success and krill abundance. To improve the respon-siveness of the ecosystem-based management ap- proach adopted by the Commission for the Conserva-tion of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), critical knowledge gaps need to be filled. In addition to a better understanding of the factors influencing recruitment, management will require a better un- derstanding of the resilience and the genetic plasti-city of krill life stages, and a quantitative understand-ing of under-ice and benthic habitat use.

We used the technique to compare total RNA and DNA content and RNA:DNA ratios of C. finmarchicus copepodite stages cultured at different food densities. Copepods reared at growth-limiting phytoplankton concentrations (25 µg carbon l-1) were smaller, had lower RNA:DNA ratios, and contained less total RNA and DNA than did copepods reared in excess food (500 µg C l-1). This was true for each stage from C1 to C5. Stages C5 and C4 C. finmarchicus collected from Georges Bank and the Gulf of Maine were compared to those from the laboratory experiment. While RNA:DNA ratios of C5 and C4 individuals collected in May and June 1994 were intermediate between the 2 lab treatments, Stage C5 C. finmarchicus collected in November 1993 had the lowest RNA:DNA ratios of all copepods sampled. This seasonality of RNA:DNA ratios is most likely related to food availability and changing metabolic activity. Our data show that RNA is a useful index of physiological condition for C. finmarchicus.},

A range of recent studies give fascinating insight into cellular strategies for keeping gene expression in tune with physiological needs dictated by the environment, promoting adaptation to both short- and long-term environmental changes. Not only do organisms show great resilience to external challenges, but emerging data suggest that they also exploit these challenges to fuel phenotypic variation and evolutionary innovation.},

The circadian system ensures anticipation and adaptation to daily environmental changes, and functions on different levels — from gene expression to behaviour.

In an attempt to illuminate genetic markers for future population and phylogenetic analysis, five E. superba mitogenomes, from samples collected west of the Antarctic Peninsula, were sequenced using new 454 next-generation sequencing techniques. The sequences, of lengths between 13,310 and 13,326 base pairs, were then analyzed in the context of two previously-published near-complete sequences. Sequences revealed relatively well-conserved partial mitochondrial genomes which included complete sequences for 11 of 13 protein-coding genes, 16 of 23 tRNAs, and the large ribosomal subunit. Partial sequences were also recovered for cox1 and the small ribosomal subunit. Sequence analysis suggested that the cox2, nad5, and nad6 genes would be the best candidates for future population genetics analyses, due to their high number of variable sites. Future work to reveal the noncoding control region remains.},

	doi = {10.1186/1742-9994-5-12},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identification of DNA sequence diversity is a powerful means for assessing the species present in environmental samples. The most common molecular strategies for estimating taxonomic composition depend upon PCR with universal primers that amplify an orthologous DNA region from a range of species. The diversity of sequences within a sample that can be detected by universal primers is often compromised by high concentrations of some DNA templates. If the DNA within the sample contains a small number of sequences in relatively high concentrations, then less concentrated sequences are often not amplified because the PCR favours the dominant DNA types. This is a particular problem in molecular diet studies, where predator DNA is often present in great excess of food-derived DNA. RESULTS: We have developed a strategy where a universal PCR simultaneously amplifies DNA from food items present in DNA purified from stomach samples, while the predator's own DNA is blocked from amplification by the addition of a modified predator-specific blocking primer. Three different types of modified primers were tested out; one annealing inhibiting primer overlapping with the 3' end of one of the universal primers, another annealing inhibiting primer also having an internal modification of five dI molecules making it a dual priming oligo, and a third elongation arrest primer located between the two universal primers. All blocking primers were modified with a C3 spacer. In artificial PCR mixtures, annealing inhibiting primers proved to be the most efficient ones and this method reduced predator amplicons to undetectable levels even when predator template was present in 1000 fold excess of the prey template. The prey template then showed strong PCR amplification where none was detectable without the addition of blocking primer. Our method was applied to identifying the winter food of one of the most abundant animals in the world, the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba. Dietary item DNA was PCR amplified from a range of species in krill stomachs for which we had no prior sequence knowledge. CONCLUSION: We present a simple, robust and cheap method that is easily adaptable to many situations where a rare DNA template is to be PCR amplified in the presence of a higher concentration template with identical PCR primer binding sites},

The volume of fluid moving at greater than 10\% of the maximum velocity near the pleopods is roughly 18 times larger than the volume of the krill. Thus, the hydrodynamic disturbance occupies a significantly larger region than the animal body. Other krill, sensing the flow disturbance, may take advantage of the flow induced by a neighbor to locate a mate or to draft for efficient propulsion.},

	abstract = {The brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens (Hemiptera, Delphacidae), is one of the most important rice pests. Abundant genetic studies on BPH have been conducted using reverse-transcription quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Using qRT-PCR, the expression levels of target genes are calculated on the basis of endogenous controls. These genes need to be appropriately selected by experimentally assessing whether they are stably expressed under different conditions. However, such studies on potential reference genes in N. lugens are lacking. In this paper, we presented a systematic exploration of eight candidate reference genes in N. lugens, namely, actin 1 (ACT), muscle actin (MACT), ribosomal protein S11 (RPS11), ribosomal protein S15e (RPS15), alpha 2-tubulin (TUB), elongation factor 1 delta (EF), 18S ribosomal RNA (18S), and arginine kinase (AK) and used four alternative methods (BestKeeper, geNorm, NormFinder, and the delta Ct method) to evaluate the suitability of these genes as endogenous controls. We examined their expression levels among different experimental factors (developmental stage, body part, geographic population, temperature variation, pesticide exposure, diet change, and starvation) following the MIQE (Minimum Information for publication of Quantitative real time PCR Experiments) guidelines. Based on the results of RefFinder, which integrates four currently available major software programs to compare and rank the tested candidate reference genes, RPS15, RPS11, and TUB were found to be the most suitable reference genes in different developmental stages, body parts, and geographic populations, respectively. RPS15 was the most suitable gene under different temperature and diet conditions, while RPS11 was the most suitable gene under different pesticide exposure and starvation conditions. This work sheds light on establishing a standardized qRT-PCR procedure in N. lugens, and serves as a starting point for screening for reference genes for expression studies of related insects.},

The recruitment index (R1), based on the relative abundance of the 1+ age class, varies substantially between years, whereas it is quite similar between different surveys within the same field season. The overall mean recruitment index for all years was Rmean = 0.210. Good recruitment was observed for the 1980/81, 1985/86, 1987/88, and 1990/91 year classes; exceedingly poor recruitment occurred for the 1976/77, 1982/83, 1983/84, 1988/89, 1991/92 and 1992/93 year classes. Pairwise correlations between the stock parameters, recruitment indices, and available environmental data indicate that good and poor year class success are directly and indirectly related to sea ice conditions during the preceding winter season, the timing of krill spawning, and the occurrence of dense salp concentrations. No correlation is shown with upper water column temperature or krill stock/spawning stock size. A concept is developed describing the interactions of various parameters leading to good or poor krill recruitment.},

	abstract = {The physiological condition and feeding activity of the dominant larval stages of Eu-phausia superba(calyptopis stage III, furcilia stages I and II) were investigated from February to March 2000 at the Rothera Time Series monitoring station (67$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$34S, 68$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$07W, Adelaide Island, West-ern Antarctic Peninsula). A dense phytoplankton bloom (5 to 25 g chl al-1) occupied the mixed layer throughout the study period. The feeding of larvae was measured by incubating the animals in natural seawater. Food concentrations ranged from 102 to 518 g C l-1across experiments, and the mean daily C rations were 28\% body C for calyptosis stage III (CIII), 25\% for furcilia stage I (FI) and 15\% for FII. The phytoplankton, dominated by diatoms and motile prey taxa, ranged from 8 to 79 m in size. Across this size spectrum of diatoms, CIII cleared small cells most efficiently, as did FI to a lesser degree. FII, however, showed no clear tendency for a specific cell size. Across the measured size spectrum of the motile taxa, all larvae stages showed a clear preference towards the larger cells. Estimated C assimi-lation efficiencies were high, from 70 to 92\% (mean 84\%). Respiration rates of freshly caught larvae were 0.7 to 1.1 l O2mg DM-1h-1. The calculated respiratory C loss showed a significant increase with increasing food concentration in all larval stages, ranging from 0.9 to 2.4\% body C d-1. These respira-tory losses, combined with the high assimilation efficiencies, thus give the larvae ample capacity for growth at these food concentrations. Critical concentrations of food to achieve maximum daily rations were in the range of 100 to 200 g C l-1 ( 2 to 4 g chl a l-1). Thus productive shelf sites along the Antarctic Peninsula, such as Rothera, may act as good nursery areas for krill larvae.},

	abstract = {The marine ecosystem of the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) extends from the Bellingshausen Sea to the northern tip of the peninsula and from the mostly glaciated coast across the continental shelf to the shelf break in the west. The glacially sculpted coastline along the peninsula is highly convoluted and characterized by deep embayments that are often interconnected by channels that facilitate transport of heat and nutrients into the shelf domain. The ecosystem is divided into three subregions, the continental slope, shelf and coastal regions, each with unique ocean dynamics, water mass and biological distributions. The WAP shelf lies within the Antarctic Sea Ice Zone (SIZ) and like other SIZs, the WAP system is very productive, supporting large stocks of marine mammals, birds and the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba. Ecosystem dynamics is dominated by the seasonal and interannual variation in sea ice extent and retreat. The Antarctic Peninsula is one among the most rapidly warming regions on Earth, having experienced a 28C increase in the annual mean temperature and a 68C rise in the mean winter temperature since 1950. Delivery of heat from the Antarctic Circumpolar Current has increased significantly in the past decade, sufficient to drive to a 0.68C warming of the upper 300 m of shelf water. In the past 50 years and continuing in the twenty-first century, the warm, moist maritime climate of the northern WAP has been migrating south, displacing the once dominant cold, dry continental Antarctic climate and causing multi-level responses in the marine ecosystem. Ecosystem responses to the regional warming include increased heat transport, decreased sea ice extent and duration, local declines in ice-dependent Adelie penguins, increase in ice-tolerant gentoo and chinstrap penguins, alterations in phytoplankton and zooplankton community composition and changes in krill recruitment, abundance and availability to predators. The climate/ecological gradients extending along the WAP and the presence of monitoring systems, field stations and long-term research programmes make the region an invaluable observatory of climate change and marine ecosystem response.},

In addition to being cryptochrome genes from one of the earliest-diverging eumetazoan phyla, cry1 and cry2 were expressed preferentially in light. Consistent with potential roles in the synchronization of fundamentally important behaviors such as mass spawning, cry2 expression increased on full moon nights versus new moon nights. Our results demonstrate phylogenetically broad roles of these ancient circadian clock–related molecules in the animal kingdom.},

	abstract = {Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, shapes the structure of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. Its central position in the food web, the ongoing environmental changes due to climatic warming, and increasing commercial interest on this species emphasize the urgency of understanding the adaptability of krill to its environment. Krill has evolved rhythmic physiological and behavioral functions which are synchronized with the daily and seasonal cycles of the complex Southern Ocean ecosystem. The mechanisms, however, leading to these rhythms are essentially unknown. Here, we show that krill possesses an endogenous circadian clock that governs metabolic and physiological output rhythms. We found that expression of the canonical clock gene cry2 was highly rhythmic both in a light-dark cycle and in constant darkness. We detected a remarkable short circadian period, which we interpret as a special feature of the krills circadian clock that helps to entrain the circadian system to the extreme range of photoperiods krill is exposed to throughout the year. Furthermore, we found that important key metabolic enzymes of krill showed bimodal circadian oscillations (,912 h period) in transcript abundance and enzymatic activity. Oxygen consumption of krill showed ,912 h oscillations that correlated with the temporal activity profile of key enzymes of aerobic energy metabolism. Our results demonstrate the first report of an endogenous circadian timing system in Antarctic krill and its likely link to metabolic key processes. Krills circadian clock may not only be critical for synchronization to the solar day but also for the control of seasonal events. This study provides a powerful basis for the investigation into the mechanisms of temporal synchronization in this marine key species and will also lead to the first comprehensive analyses of the circadian clock of a polar marine organism through the entire photoperiodic cycle.},

- investiagtion of temporal mRNA expression levels of the canonical clock gene cry2 under light-dark cycle and constant darkness- tested whether gene expression of metabolic key enzymes in these krill show daily or circadian oscillations- to what extent transcirptional oscillations of these enzymes also perist at the protein-activity level- determination of oscillatory rhythms at the organismic physiological level in krill by measuring temporal profiles of oxygen consumption
 
What they did
- measuring transcript levels of cry2 using quantitative PCR- samples from 2008 and 2010- whole heads for krill analysis (including putative oscillator regions suchs as retina, eyestalk system and different neuronal brain structures)
 
What they found out
older experiment (2008):
- expression of cry2 highly rythmic (LD and DD cycle)- cry 2 transcripts showed significantly daily oscillations- expression upregulated with a peak around 12:00 (middle of light phase), lowest amount around two hours after lights-off (24:00 h)- resulty correspond with wild caught krill, cry 2 being highest throughout the day- also after light regime changing from LD to DD still significant circadian oscillation on the third day after shifting observable
 
experiment (2010):
- obseravtion of first and second consecutive days after LD cycle --{\textgreater} no significant periodicity of cry2 mRNA level, but upregulation of cry 2 during the middle of the day, but 4 hours later than under the LD cycle (16:00 h)- at 12:00 h lowest cry2 mRNA level (significant)- circadian profile with a period of {\textasciitilde}18 hours (DD)
 
Their speculation
- circadian system of krill has to delay every day by several hours to keep a stable phase of entrainment in the light dark environment (phase of entrainment under selective pressure)- implies that the circadian system of krill probably has a high amplitude phase response curve for light- main distribution of krill range from {\textasciitilde}21 hours of light in summer to {\textasciitilde}3 hours of light in winter- proved: in extreme photoperiods entrainment is more difficult to achieve than in symmetrical light-dark cycles
 
Future investigations
- other canonical clock genes such as period, timeless, clock and cycle
 
Their further experiments: metabolic activity
- tested whether metabolic functions in krill are under circadian regulation- measured expression and activity of key metabolic enzymes: CS, TRY, AK and NAGase- AK: in glycolysis; CS: in citric acid; TRY: dominant proteinase in Antarctic krill playing major role in digestive system- all showed circadian oscillations in transcript abundance and enzyme activity- CS, TRY and AK showed oscillatory patterns with 9-12 h period under LD (similar phase relationship) --{\textgreater} NGAase different phase relationship)- CS, TRY and AK direct or indriect related to carbohydrate metabolism
 
Results CS
- key enzyme of aerobic energy metabolism- CS activity shows corresponding temporal changes in oxygen consumption- BUT: 12 h bimodial behavioural rythm (e.g. locomotor activity) may also have contributed to these oscillations- link between carbohydrate metabolism and locomotor activuty previously showed in some crustacean species
 
Results NAGase
- not associated with carbohydrate metabolism- key enzyme in the moulting process of krill- needed to degrade chitin microfibers of the cuticle- could explain different oscillatory pattern --{\textgreater} different mode of circadian regulation, more similar to clock gene expression
 
Their general assumption
- the krill endogenous circadian clock governs metabolic and physiological output rythms which, in the case of CS, TRY and AK, they interpret as evidence of a circadian bimodal output},

	abstract = {Long-term changes in the physical environment in the Antarctic Peninsula region have significant potential for affecting populations of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), a keystone food web species. In order to investigate this, we analysed data on krill-eating predators at South Georgia from 1980 to 2000. Indices of population size and reproductive performance showed declines in all species and an increase in the frequency of years of low reproductive output. Changes in the population structure of krill and its relationship with reproductive performance suggested that the biomass of krill within the largest size class was sufficient to support predator demand in the 1980s but not in the 1990s. We suggest that the effects of underlying changes in the system on the krill population structure have been amplified by predator-induced mortality, resulting in breeding predators now regularly operating close to the limit of krill availability. Understanding how krill demography is affected by changes in physical environmental factors and by predator consumption and how, in turn, this influences predator performance and survival, is one of the keys to predicting future change in Antarctic marine ecosystems},

	abstract = {The pelagic ecosystem around the island of South Georgia is subject to significant interannual variability, and changes in zooplankton community composition can be used as natural ecosystem experiments to examine biogeochemical cycles. The biomass of the large euphausiid Antarctic krill may range from ca. 2 to 150 g fresh mass (FM) m−2. When krill biomass is low, copepod biomass may be correspondingly higher and overall zooplankton biomass remains more or less unchanged. Krill are omnivorous, feeding facultatively either as grazers on microplankton or as predators on smaller zooplankton. This leads to complex feedbacks within the plankton. A simple model of the phytoplankton–copepod–krill system is used to simulate two scenarios of zooplankton composition. For the “low krill-high copepod” scenario, the model predicts higher phytoplankton biomass and production, lower mixed layer (ML) ammonium, nitrate and silicate concentrations, and higher detrital carbon production than in the “high krill-low copepod” scenario. Nitrogen cycling provides the most explicit demonstration of the differences between the scenarios. For the “low krill-high copepod” scenario, ML ammonium concentration decreased by 25\% over 20 days, but excretion by metazooplankton supplied 30\% of phytoplankton nitrogen demand. In the “high krill-low copepod” scenario, ML ammonium only declined by 10\% over 20 days, but metazooplankton excretion was much lower, at 10\% of phytoplankton N demand. These predictions are compared with data from several surveys covering krill biomass in the range 10–55 g FM m−2. Phytoplankton chlorophyll biomass is negatively related to krill biomass, and ML nutrients are positively correlated with krill biomass in these data. Both observations and model results suggest that variation in biogeochemical carbon and nitrogen cycles in the South Georgia pelagic ecosystem is determined largely by changes in zooplankton community composition and its impact on phytoplankton dynamics.},

Although the reagent would seem to be recommended by its great sen- sitivity and the simplicity of procedure possible with its use, it has not found great favor for general biochemical purposes. In the belief that this reagent, nevertheless, has considerable merit for certain application, but that its peculiarities and limitations need to be understood for its fullest exploitation, it has been studied with regard t.o effects of variations in pH, time of reaction, and concentration of react- ants, permissible levels of reagents commonly used in handling proteins, and interfering subst.ances.

Two deep stations (4100 m) west of the South Orkney Islands yielded more than 6600 eggs and early larvae per 100 m3 in the 1000 to 2000 m layer; also below 2000 m eggs and naupliar stages occurred. Sinking speed and sinking depth of krill eggs are discussed in the light of laboratory experiments of Marschall (1983), Quetin and Ross (1984), and George and Str{\textbackslash}textbackslash"omberg (1985). Hatching depths calculated from the experimental data on sinking rate and incubation time tend to be shallower than the deep occurrence of krill eggs at sea. Possibly krill may spawn not only near the surface but also at depths of several hundred meters. The high abundance of naupliar stages in smaples from our deepest layer corrobrate the presumption of Marschall and Hirche (1984) that the nearly immobile nauplii still sink and that the larvae begin to rise only when they have reached the metanaupliar stage.},

A bile salt-dependent lipase (BSDL) was purified from either defatted powder of cod pyloric caeca or aqueous pancreatic extracts by combined affinity chromatography on cholate-Sepharose and gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 HR. By SDS-PAGE analysis the molecular weight of purified cod BSDL was estimated to 60 kDa. The enzyme was totally dependent on bile salts for hydrolysis of insoluble fatty acid esters. Antiserum raised against purified cod BSDL reacted specifically with selected mammalian pancreatic BSDLs by Western blot analysis. Results presented in this paper strongly suggest that the bile salt-dependent lipase is the only pancreatic enzyme involved in lipid digestion in cod. The enzyme has been characterized and compared to human pancreatic BSDL with respect to substrate specificity, temperature- and pH-dependence and inhibitors. Both soluble and insoluble fatty acid esters were hydrolysed and the enzyme was 1,3-specific in hydrolysis of triolein. The enzyme was inhibited by di-isopropyl fluorophosphate and phenyl boronic acid, but not significantly by phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride. The cod BSDL is probably homologous to mammalian pancreatic BSDLs.},

Spatial shifts in spawning habitats of Arcto-Norwegian cod related to multidecadal climate oscillations and climate change. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 65: 953–962.Arcto-Norwegian cod tend to produce strong year classes in warm years and poor year classes in cold years. This work shows that spawning intensity at various spawning sites along 1500 km of Norwegian coast is also influenced by climate variations. However, while the recruitment response to temperature is immediate and on an interannual time-scale, the response to changes in spawning site is slower, on a multidecadal time-scale. There have been two cold and two warm periods during the 20th century, cold from 1900 to 1920, warm from 1930 to 1950, cold from 1960 to 1970, and warm since the mid-1980s. A time-series for 1900–1976 on cod roe indices along the coast shows that the southernmost spawning areas are more important during cold periods, and the northernmost ones in warm periods, and coincide with high population fecundity. After 1976, qualitative observations show that there have been poor spawning fisheries in the southernmost spawning areas during the present warm period. From 2003, spawning has been observed along the coast of East Finnmark where it did not transpire during the previous 40 years.},

Reference genes are assumed to be at a constant expression level, over a range of conditions such as temperature. These genes, such as GADPH and beta-actin, are used extensively for gene expression studies using techniques like quantitative PCR. There have been several studies carried out on identifying reference genes. However, a lot of evidence indicates issues to the general suitability of these genes. Recent studies had shown that different factors, including the environment and methods, play an important role in changing the expression levels of the reference genes. Thus, we conclude that there is no reference gene that can deemed suitable for all the experimental conditions. In addition, we believe that every experiment will require the scientific evaluation and selection of the best candidate gene for use as a reference gene to obtain reliable scientific results},

There was a significant correlation between the independently measured individual growth rates and the RNA?:?DNA ratio and also the RNA concentration of krill tissue, although the strength of the relationship was only modest. DNA concentration, on average, was relatively constant, irrespective of the growth rates. The moult stage did not appear to have a significant effect on the nucleic acid contents of tissue. Overall, the amount of both nucleic acids varied considerably between individuals. Nucleic acid-based indicators may provide information concerning the recent growth and nutritional status of krill and further experimentation under controlled conditions is warranted. They are, however, reasonably costly and time-consuming measurements.},

Groups of seven, eight or nine were then starved for 5, 10 or 15 days, respectively. Control groups of seven prawns each were fed ad lib for the same periods. The oxygen consumption and ammonia-N excretion over 24 h of each prawn was measured, using antibiotics to minimise bacterial growth during the excretion measurements. Oxygen consumption fell sharply by 24–29\% during the first 5 days of starvation and then levelled out. Ammonia-N excretion increased 46–73\% with starvation. O:N ratios fell to about 7:1 after the first 5 days of starvation and remained at this level up to 15 days, indicating that protein is virtually the only energy substrate under these conditions. These results support previous research that showed that the carnivorous P. esculentus uses muscle protein preferentially as a source of energy during starvation. In fed prawns, O:N ratios were also low (13.6–16.4:1), indicating that protein is normally a major source of energy.},

	abstract = {Two isoforms of pyruvate kinase (PK I and PK II) were partly purified and characterized from the Nordic krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica. Both PK variants were present in summer and winter specimens with a tissue specificity in abdominal muscle (PK I) and cephalothorax (PK II). Obvious differences were found in chromatographic and kinetic characteristics. Enzymatic adaptations to low temperatures were found in PK I only, whereas PK II did not contribute to seasonal temperature adaptation. In winter specimens, the activation energy of PK I decreased significantly from 53.2 1.5 to 50.2 1.2 kJmol1. The affinity of PK I to phosphoenol-pyruvate was higher in winter (KM = 0.024 0.002 mmoll1) compared to summer (KM = 0.033 0.003 mmoll1). Both effects lead to an increased efficiency of this enzyme isoform in the cold. In contrast, KM values of PK II showed no significant differences between summer (KM = 0.181 0.014 mmoll1) and winter specimens (KM = 0.193 0.015 mmoll1). The effects of cooperativity remained unchanged during the seasons with approximate values of nHill = 1.0 (PK I) and 1.5 (PK II). Fructose-1,6-bis-phosphate affected only PK II by shifting sigmoidal kinetics to hyperbolic curves resulting in a decrease of KM to 0.027 mmoll1. Further effectors were tested showing an inhibiting effect of oxalate on both isoforms with a reduction to 20\% and 50\% in PK I and PK II, respectively. Presumably, the ecophysiological effect of the capacity to regulate muscle PK is related to the necessity to increase motility during vertical migration and phases of feeding activity.},

Larvae of Thysanoessa macrura were found in all types of waters. Within the intermediate (confluence) zone, these larvae were most scanty and younger than those found anywhere. In distinction from the last two species, larvae of E. crystallorophias were abundant only at the southwestern inshore region. There was a notable decrease of the larval abundance of all species and a strong contrast of age composition in the Palmer Archipelago region. Larvae are older to the north-east than to the south-west of this area. In the oceanic zone (ACC), T. macrura begins to spawn after E. frigida.

	abstract = {The ocean around South Georgia, in the southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, is highly productive, with large stocks of Antarctic krill supporting extensive colonies of marine- and land-based predators. The operation of this ecosystem is strongly influenced by physical forcings, and the role of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon has been highlighted previously. Here we examine in detail the transmission of \{ENSO\} signals to South Georgia, and investigate other sources of interannual variability. \{ENSO\} variability generates anomalies in sea-surface temperature (SST) across the South Pacific via atmospheric teleconnections. These anomalies are advected toward South Georgia within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), and previous studies have focussed on long-period advection (order of 23 years) from the southwest Pacific. We observe here, however, that the region close to the Antarctic Peninsula in the southeast Pacific is especially susceptible to \{ENSO\} forcing via anomalous meridional winds; this induces \{SST\} anomalies that are advected to South Georgia on a much more rapid timescale (order 56 months). The phasing of these teleconnections is such that anomalies that reach the southeast Pacific from farther west tend to be reinforced here by airseaice interaction. We also find an important role for the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) in determining \{SST\} variability at South Georgia. This is a circumpolar mode of climate variability, and thus can readily influence local \{SST\} at South Georgia directly. The \{SAM\} is, however, not perfectly zonally symmetric, and (like ENSO) has a particular impact on meridional winds in the southeast Pacific. The average timescale for \{SAM\} influence on South Georgia \{SST\} is shorter than that of ENSO, since it includes a stronger component of direct local forcing. The South Georgia ecosystem is not self-sustaining, with import of krill from breeding and nursery grounds upstream in the \{ACC\} being important. We speculate here that these varying meridional winds close to the Antarctic Peninsula play a direct role in promoting/restricting the injection of shelf waters (and the krill therein) into the ACC, following which anomalies in krill density would be advected toward South Georgia. This offers a dynamical mechanism that might contribute to interannual changes in biological communities at South Georgia, in addition to existing theories. Both \{SAM\} and \{ENSO\} have shown long-period changes in recent decades, with \{ENSO\} exhibiting a higher preponderance of El Niño events compared with La Niña events, and the \{SAM\} showing a marked trend toward a higher index state. Such long-period behaviour is likely to induce changes in the South Georgia ecosystem via their impacts on advection and SST, for which an understanding of the physical mechanisms elucidated here will be key to unravelling.},

The binding of the dye to protein causes a shift in the absorption maximum of the dye from 465 to 595 nm, and it is the increase in absorption at 595 nm which is monitored. This assay is very reproducible and rapid with the dye binding process virtually complete in approximately 2 min with good color stability for 1 hr. There is little or no interference from cations such as sodium or potassium nor from carbohydrates such as sucrose. A small amount of color is developed in the presence of strongly alkaline buffering agents, but the assay may be run accurately by the use of proper buffer controls. The only components found to give excessive interfering color in the assay are relatively large amounts of detergents such as sodium dodecyl sulfate, Triton X-100, and commercial glassware detergents. Interference by small amounts of detergent may be eliminated by the use of proper controls.},

Throughout the survey area, Salpa thompsoni accounted for \&gt;95\% of the total salp stock while Ihlea racovitzai was consistently represented in very low abundances. Maximum densities of S. thompsoni, with ≈4000 ind. 1000 m−3, were recorded in the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) in December when chlorophyll-a concentrations were well below 1 mg m−3. A dramatic decrease in salp stock was observed at the beginning of January, when S. thompsoni virtually disappeared from the most productive area of the MIZ where chlorophyll-a concentrations had by then reached bloom levels of 1.5–3 mg (Chl-a) m−3. In situ grazing measurements showed that throughout the cruise S. thompsoni exhibited the highest ingestion rates per individual of any of the most abundant components of the grazing pelagic community, with maxima of ≈160 μg (pigm) ind. −1 d−1. These feeding rates are 3 to 5 times higher than those previously obtained using in vitro incubations. The total daily consumption of the population of S. thompsoni varied from 0.3 to 108\% of daily primary production. We suggest that competitive removal of food by S. thompsoni, rather than direct predation, is responsible for the low krill abundances generally associated with salp swarms.},

	abstract = {Recent analyses have shown that significant changes have occurred in patterns of sea ice seasonality in West Antarctica since 1979, with wide-ranging climatic, biological and biogeochemical consequences. Here, we provide the first detailed report on long-term change and variability in annual timings of sea ice advance, retreat and resultant ice season duration in East Antarctica. These were calculated from satellite-derived ice concentration data for the period 1979/80 to 2009/10. The pattern of change in sea ice seasonality off East Antarctica comprises mixed signals on regional to local scales, with pockets of strongly positive and negative trends occurring in near juxtaposition in certain regions e.g., Prydz Bay. This pattern strongly reflects change and variability in different elements of the marine “icescape”, including fast ice, polynyas and the marginal ice zone. A trend towards shorter sea-ice duration (of 1 to 3 days per annum) occurs in fairly isolated pockets in the outer pack from∼95–110°E, and in various near-coastal areas that include an area of particularly strong and persistent change near Australia's Davis Station and between the Amery and West Ice Shelves. These areas are largely associated with coastal polynyas that are important as sites of enhanced sea ice production/melt. Areas of positive trend in ice season duration are more extensive, and include an extensive zone from 160–170°E (i.e., the western Ross Sea sector) and the near-coastal zone between 40–100°E. The East Antarctic pattern is considerably more complex than the well-documented trends in West Antarctica e.g., in the Antarctic Peninsula-Bellingshausen Sea and western Ross Sea sectors.},

	abstract = {The effect of different light regimes on the development of sexual maturity and body composition (carbon, nitrogen, lipid and protein) of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, was studied over 12 weeks under laboratory conditions. Krill were exposed to light-cycle regimes of variable intensity to simulate Southern Ocean summer, autumn and winter conditions, respectively using: (1) continuous light (LL; 200 lux max), (2) 12-h light and 12-h darkness (LD 12:12; 50 lux max), and (3) continuous dark-ness (DD). The sexual maturity of female and male krill exposed to LL and LD 12:12 showed an accelerated succession of external maturity stages during the experimental period, while krill exposed to continuous darkness showed no changes in external maturity during the course of the study. Changes in the maturity development of krill between the different light regimes are reflected in changes in body composition. Krill exposed to LL and LD 12:12 showed an increase in lipid utilization, indicating that the development of external maturation may be fuelled preferentially by lipid reserves. In contrast, values of total lipid content of krill held under continuous darkness indicated an unchanged lipid catabolism during the course of the study. Thus, the maturity development of krill was affected either directly or indirectly by the different simulated light conditions. Based on these results, and observations on the effects of simulated light regimes on feeding and metabolic rates of krill available from a previous study, we suggest that the Antarctic light regime is an essential cue governing the seasonal cycle of krill physiology and maturity, and highlight the importance of this environmental factor in the life history of krill.},

	abstract = {The application of genomic approaches to marine biota has profoundly altered our understanding of life in the oceans, especially regarding concepts of adaptation, speciation and evolution. The avalanche of genomic data has provided an unbiased view of marine biology that has never been seen before. In particular, comparative and metagenomic approaches with microbes from different biogeochemical marine provinces provided the first insights into how they acquire and discard genes as needed, even across kingdom boundaries, in response to their environment. These data clearly reveal that marine microbes have remarkable abilities to change their genomes according to both environmental stresses and biotic interactions. Thus, it is most likely that the flux of energy and matter in the marine system is reflected by the presence or absence of genes and proteins in marine organisms, which could provide novel tools to understand biogeochemical processes of global significance. However, the challenge is to put the reductionistic knowledge gained by genomics and metagenomics into the larger contexts of cellular systems and ecosystems to identify emergent properties that could not have been predicted by breaking down the whole into its individual parts.},

	abstract = {The spectrophotometric iodine measurement for oxygen determination by the Winkler method is re-examined for theoretical and operational aspects. It is shown that the selection of an isobestic point for measuring the mixture of iodine and tri-iodide in the solution enhances reliability. The wavelength value of 466 nm was selected after a spectrum study. Then, performances are assessed by mean of statistical approach based on repeated standardization curves at the isobestic point compared with other wavelengths. At 466 nm, the method is linear up to about 1000 Amol kg?1 of O2. Optimization and validation of the spectrophotometric method is realized through a robustness study based on factors that may alter the results (temperature, reagent volumes, storage time). Temperature is the only factor that exerts a significant influence on the absorbance (0.5\% per jC), hence samples and standards should be kept at the same temperature within F1 jC. Precision was estimated over a 10-day period. The standard deviation was 0.45\% for inter-sample repeatability and 0.73\% for reproducibility near 250 Amol kg?1. The repeatability of 12 samples taken at the same immersion was around 0.12\%. The detection limit, determined from standardization curves, is {\textless}2 Amol kg?1. Accuracy was verified with O2 saturated seawater and found to be within the precision confidence interval. The method can be applied to the determination of dissolved oxygen in fresh or seawater samples, suboxic, or waters supersaturated in dissolved oxygen. It is suggested as being a suitable alternative to titration in most applications of the Winkler determination of dissolved oxygen.},

	abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms by which climate variability affects multiple trophic levels in food webs is essential for determining ecosystem responses to climate change. Here we use over two decades of data collected by the Palmer Long Term Ecological Research program (PAL-LTER) to determine how large-scale climate and local physical forcing affect phytoplankton, zooplankton and an apex predator along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). We show that positive anomalies in chlorophyll-a (chl-a) at Palmer Station, occurring every 4–6 years, are constrained by physical processes in the preceding winter/spring and a negative phase of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Favorable conditions for phytoplankton included increased winter ice extent and duration, reduced spring/summer winds, and increased water column stability via enhanced salinity-driven density gradients. Years of positive chl-a anomalies are associated with the initiation of a robust krill cohort the following summer, which is evident in Adélie penguin diets, thus demonstrating tight trophic coupling. Projected climate change in this region may have a significant, negative impact on phytoplankton biomass, krill recruitment and upper trophic level predators in this coastal Antarctic ecosystem.

Migratory and endemic species of whales, seals and birds benefit from the high biomass of their principal prey, krill (Euphausia superba) and cephalopods, in this area. Most species of baleen whales and male sperm whales in the Southern Hemisphere migrate between low-latitude breeding grounds in winter and highly productive Antarctic feeding grounds in summer. Here I show the importance of the southernmost reaches of the strongest ocean current, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), to a complex and predictable food web of the Southern Ocean. The circumpolar distributions of blue, fin and humpback whales from spring to midsummer trace the non-uniform high-latitude penetration of shoaled, nutrient-rich Upper Circumpolar Deep Water, which is carried eastward by the ACC. The poleward extent of this water mass delineates the Southern Boundary of the ACC and corresponds not only to the circumpolar distributions of baleen whales, but also to distributions of krill and to regions of high, seasonally averaged, phytoplankton biomass. Sperm whales, which feed on cephalopods, also congregate in highest densities near the Southern Boundary. The association of primary production, Krill, and whales with the Southern Boundary, suggests that it provides predictably productive foraging for many species, and is of critical importance to the function of the Southern Ocean ecosystem.},

Young stages (CI–CIII) were generally confined to the upper 30 m both day and night, but weak, significant DVM took place in Atlantic water masses. Older individuals were distributed progressively deeper with increasing stage. Stages CIV and males were non-migratory. Combining all stations, CV and females displayed significant DVM, but migrations were within a narrow depth range. Separating stations according to water mass, significant DVM was only observed within the Arctic domain. Older developmental stages consistently occurred in low numbers in the upper 10 m, both day and night. Contrary to expectations, the amplitude of the DVM tended to be largest in the northwestern part of the study area, representing habitats with midnight sun. Over the Norwegian Shelf and in the east of the Norwegian and Greenland Seas, herring and mackerel were regionally abundant in the upper 50 m, but their abundance decreased strongly towards the northwest. Calanus spp. were the most frequent prey items in their stomachs. The amplitudes of DVM were generally strongest in habitats with very low predator abundance. Neither concentrations of chlorophyll a nor its vertical distribution could account for the observed variations in DVM. Diel feeding rhythms (from gut fluorescence) were found throughout the ocean, except for areas with very low biomass of chlorophyll a. However, feeding patterns varied, and both enhanced and reduced nocturnal gut fluorescence were recorded.},

The Discovery Investigations in the early 20(th) century, coupled with subsequent work with both nets and echosounders, indicated that the bulk of the population of postlarval krill is typically confined to the top 150 m of the water column [1, 3, 4]. Here, we report for the first time the existence of significant numbers of Antarctic krill feeding actively at abyssal depths in the Southern Ocean. Biological observations from the deep-water remotely operated vehicle Isis in the austral summer of 2006/07 have revealed the presence of adult krill (Euphausia superba Dana), including gravid females, at unprecedented depths in Marguerite Bay, western Antarctic Peninsula. Adult krill were found close to the seabed at all depths but were absent from fjords close inshore. At all locations where krill were detected they were seen to be actively feeding, and at many locations there were exuviae (cast molts). These observations revise significantly our understanding of the depth distribution and ecology of Antarctic krill, a central organism in the Southern Ocean ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Tidal cycles at benthic habitats induce a set of periodic environmental changes in variables like salinity, temperature and sediment water content which are able to stress benthic organisms. Consequently, a natural selection temporally correlated with tides affects the fitness of genotypes (wi) depending on their adaptation degree. Classic population genetics demonstrate that (1) rhythmic wi is more restrictive than equivalent spatial variations to preserve genetic variance, and (2) mean fitness of the population ( w ¯ ) does not have to be enhanced by genetic variance (σ2w). The present study develops a simple replicator dynamics-based model of continuous selection, where wi of multiple asexual genotypes fluctuates as a sinusoid. The amplitude of w was set as 0.5 (1 − wmin), whereas the ratio of tide period to generation time (h) was defined. Overall, the model shows that if h \&gt; 1, then the success of an advantageous genotype is exposed to randomness, and w ¯ may decrease over generations. In contrast, if h \&lt; 1 the success is deterministic, is limiting co-dominance, and only depends on wmin. The amount of different genotypes buffers the decay of σ2w and hence increases cohesiveness. Finally, the reliability of the model is analyzed for a set of target intertidal and brackish water organisms.},

	abstract = {The pervasive influence of temperature on biological systems necessitates a suite of temperaturecompensatory adaptations that span all levels of biological organizationfrom behavior to fine-scale molecular structure. Beginning about 50 years ago, physiological studies conducted with whole organisms or isolated tissues, by such pioneers of comparative thermal physiology as V.Ya. Alexandrov, T.H. Bullock, F.E.J. Fry, H. Precht, C.L. Prosser, and P.F. Scholander, began to document in detail the abilities of ectothermic animals to sustain relatively similar rates of metabolic activity at widely different temperatures of adaptation or acclimation. These studies naturally led to investigation of the roles played by enzymatic proteins in metabolic temperature compensation. Peter Hochachka's laboratory became an epicenter of this new focus in comparative physiology. The studies of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) that he initiated as a PhD student at Duke University in the mid-1960s and continued for several years at the University of British Columbia laid much of the foundation for subsequent studies of protein adaptation to temperature. Studies of orthologs of \{LDH\} have revealed the importance of conserving kinetic properties (catalytic rate constants (kcat) and Michaelis-Menten constants (Km)) and structural stability during adaptation to temperature, and recently have identified the types of amino acid substitutions causing this adaptive variation. The roles of pH and low-molecular-mass organic solutes (osmolytes) in conserving the functional and structural properties of enzymes also have been elucidated using LDH. These studies, begun in Peter Hochachka's laboratory almost 40 years ago, have been instrumental in the development of a conceptual framework for the study of biochemical adaptation, a field whose origin can be traced largely to his creative influences. This framework emphasizes the complementary roles of three strategies of adaptation: (1) changes in amino acid sequence that cause adaptive variation in the kinetic properties and stabilities of proteins, (2) shifts in concentrations of proteins, which are mediated through changes in gene expression and protein turnover; and (3) changes in the milieu in which proteins function, which conserve the intrinsic properties of proteins established by their primary structure and modulate protein activity in response to physiological needs. This theoretical framework has helped guide research in adaptational biochemistry for many years and now stands poised to play a critical role in the post-genomic era, as physiologists grapple with the challenge of integrating the wealth of new data on gene sequences (genome), gene expression (transcriptome and proteome), and metabolic profiles (metabolome) into a realistic physiological context that takes into account the evolutionary histories and environmental relationships of species.},

	volume = {43},
	issn = {0065-2881},
	abstract = {Around Antarctica the annual five-fold growth and decay of sea ice is the most prominent physical process and has a profound impact on marine life there. In winter the pack ice canopy extends to cover almost 20 million square kilometres--some 8\% of the southern hemisphere and an area larger than the Antarctic continent itself (13.2 million square kilometres)--and is one of the largest, most dynamic ecosystems on earth. Biological activity is associated with all physical components of the sea-ice system: the sea-ice surface; the internal sea-ice matrix and brine channel system; the underside of sea ice and the waters in the vicinity of sea ice that are modified by the presence of sea ice. Microbial and microalgal communities proliferate on and within sea ice and are grazed by a wide range of proto- and macrozooplankton that inhabit the sea ice in large concentrations. Grazing organisms also exploit biogenic material released from the sea ice at ice break-up or melt. Although rates of primary production in the underlying water column are often low because of shading by sea-ice cover, sea ice itself forms a substratum that provides standing stocks of bacteria, algae and grazers significantly higher than those in ice-free areas. Decay of sea ice in summer releases particulate and dissolved organic matter to the water column, playing a major role in biogeochemical cycling as well as seeding water column phytoplankton blooms. Numerous zooplankton species graze sea-ice algae, benefiting additionally because the overlying sea-ice ceiling provides a refuge from surface predators. Sea ice is an important nursery habitat for Antarctic krill, the pivotal species in the Southern Ocean marine ecosystem. Some deep-water fish migrate to shallow depths beneath sea ice to exploit the elevated concentrations of some zooplankton there. The increased secondary production associated with pack ice and the sea-ice edge is exploited by many higher predators, with seals, seabirds and whales aggregating there. As a result, much of the Southern Ocean pelagic whaling was concentrated at the edge of the marginal ice zone. The extent and duration of sea ice fluctuate periodically under the influence of global climatic phenomena including the El Niño Southern Oscillation. Life cycles of some associated species may reflect this periodicity. With evidence for climatic warming in some regions of Antarctica, there is concern that ecosystem change may be induced by changes in sea-ice extent. The relative abundance of krill and salps appears to change interannually with sea-ice extent, and in warm years, when salps proliferate, krill are scarce and dependent predators suffer severely. Further research on the Southern Ocean sea-ice system is required, not only to further our basic understanding of the ecology, but also to provide ecosystem managers with the information necessary for the development of strategies in response to short- and medium-term environmental changes in Antarctica. Technological advances are delivering new sampling platforms such as autonomous underwater vehicles that are improving vastly our ability to sample the Antarctic under sea-ice environment. Data from such platforms will enhance greatly our understanding of the globally important Southern Ocean sea-ice ecosystem.},

The extensive data now available on the lipids of Arctic and Antarctic euphausiids show that all species are characterised by a seasonally high lipid content, and neutral lipids, whether wax esters or triacylglycerols, are primarily accumulated for reproduction. The Arctic Thysanoessa inermis and the Antarctic Euphausia crystallorophias contain high levels of wax esters and higher concentrations of 18:4(n3) and 20:5(n3) and a lower ratio of 18:1(n9)/(n7) fatty acids in their neutral lipids than the Arctic Thysanoessa raschii and the Antarctic Thysanoessa macrura and Euphausia superba. Large amounts of phytol in the lipids of T. raschii and E. crystallorophias during winter suggest the ingestion of decaying algae originating in sedimenting material or in sea ice. Thysanoessa raschii, T. macrura, and E. superba have a high ratio of 18:1(n9)/ (n7) fatty acids, indicating animal carnivory. We conclude that T. inermis and E. crystallorophias are true high polar herbivores, while T. raschii, T. macrura, and E. superba are omnivores with a more boreal distribution. The Arctic spe- cies Thysanoessa longicaudata and Meganyctiphanes norvegica are carnivores feeding on Calanus, as indicated by high amounts of 20:1(n9) and 22:1(n11) fatty acids.},

Although krill and their larvae are primarily considered to be herbivores, the experiments showed that furcilia have much higher grazing rates on copepods and ciliates than on algae. Despite the large predation impact of furcilia on ciliates, the trophic levels beneath ciliates did not respond to the addition of furcilia, suggesting that top-down control of the Antarctic microbial food web does not play a major role during the austral autumn. The experiments also demonstrate that predation on heterotrophic food organisms is a plausible explanation for the survival of furcilia over the Antarctic winter.},

A mean oxygen consumption and nitrogen excretion ratio of 31.1 measured on board ship at ambient ocean temperatures suggested that larval and juvenile krill from ice-covered waters were primarily herbivorous. Results from both shipboard and laboratory experiments demonstrated that oxygen consumption increased with temperature, but that larvae subjected to acute temperature increases exhibited higher rates. Experiments conducted at near ambient water temperatures for winter were also conducted to test the effect of habitat on the energy requirements of larval and juvenile krill. A comparison of the field and laboratory studies conducted at −1.5 to −1.8 °C showed that larvae from ice-covered waters and fed larvae in the laboratory had oxygen consumption rates significantly higher than those of larvae collected from open, i.e. ice-free, water and those starved in the laboratory. Results of the comparison lend support to the concept that in winter, larval and juvenile krill are better fed in ice-covered waters than in open water, and to the hypothesis that ice biota in the pack ice are an important food resource in winter for larval and juvenile krill.},

	abstract = {The effect of temperature on the body weight and composition, and on respiration, filtration and NH3-excretion of the bivalve Donax vittatus (da Costa) has been investigated in laboratory-maintained populations under conditions of starvation.

In all experiments there was a steady mortality, which showed little temperature dependence. The experimental animals lost weight at all temperatures, and carbohydrate, lipid and protein all contributed to this loss. The rate of loss of all components was greater at higher temperatures. There was a good agreement between the caloric loss calculated as the sum of carbohydrate and lipid loss from the body plus the protein equivalent of the ammonia excreted, and the calculated respiratory requirement in calories, but loss of protein as amino-acids also made a significant contribution to the total energy loss. During progressive starvation protein played an increasingly important rôle as a respiratory substrate.

Most of the rate functions measured showed significant effects of both experimental and acclimation temperature. The rate functions responded in different ways to temperature. For oxygen consumption and filtration rate these responses corresponded to those shown in relation to different acclimation temperatures experienced in nature. NH3-excretion was more affected by starvation, and the increase in importance of protein as a respiratory substrate.

Donax vittatus shows no evidence of complete acclimation to different temperatures; the metabolic rate is higher at higher temperatures and the increased rate is maintained even during periods of starvation by rapid utilization of reserves. Such a response to environmental changes involves both the ability to exploit short-term favourable conditions, and vulnerability to unfavourable conditions; both of which are reflected in the ecology of this and other species of Donax.},

	abstract = {Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies are revolutionizing genome research and in particular, their application to transcriptomics (RNA-seq) is increasingly being used for gene expression profiling as a replacement for microarrays. However, the properties of RNA-seq data have not been yet fully established and additional research is needed for understanding how these data respond to differential expression analysis. In this work we set out to gain insights into the characteristics of RNA-seq data analysis by studying an important parameter of this technology: the sequencing depth. We have analyzed how sequencing depth affects the detection of transcripts and their identification as differentially expressed, looking at aspects such as transcript biotype, length, expression level and fold-change. We have evaluated different algorithms available for the analysis of RNA-seq and proposed a novel approach -NOISeq- that differs from existing methods in that it is data-adaptive and non-parametric. Our results reveal that most existing methodologies suffer from a strong dependency on sequencing depth for their differential expression calls and that this results in a considerable number of false positives that increases as the number of reads grows. In contrast, our proposed method models the noise distribution from the actual data, can therefore better adapt to the size of the dataset and is more effective in controlling the rate of false discoveries. This work discusses the true potential of RNA-seq for studying regulation at low expression ranges, the noise within RNA-seq data and the issue of replication.},

	abstract = {The goldlined spinefoot, Siganus guttatus, is a lunar-synchronized spawner, which repeatedly releases gametes around the first quarter moon during the reproductive season. A previous study reported that manipulating moonlight brightness at night disrupted synchronized spawning, suggesting involvement of this natural light source in lunar synchronization. The present study examined whether the mRNA expression pattern of melatonin receptor subtypes MT1 and Mel1c in the pineal organ of the goldlined spinefoot is related to moonlight. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the abundance of MT1 and Mel1c mRNA at midnight increased during the new moon phase and decreased during the full moon phase. Exposing fish to moonlight intensity during the full moon period resulted in a decrease in Mel1c mRNA abundance within 1 h. Fluctuations in the melatonin receptor genes according to changes in the moon phase agreed with those of melatonin levels in the blood. These results indicate that periodic changes in cues from the moon influence melatonin receptor mRNA expression levels. The melatonin–melatonin receptor system may play a role in predicting the moon phase through changes in night brightness.},

In the population, from the Gullmarsfjord (west coast of Sweden), LDH was encoded for by two different Ldh-A* and -B* loci. The isoenzymes were named according to their electrophoretic mobilities. Ldh-A* locus was polymorphic. The allelic frequencies were a=0.99, a′=0.002, a′′=0.004, a′′′=0.004. The level of LDH polymorphism is low. Most individuals possess the same amount of two LDH homopolymers (LDH-A*4 and LDH-B*4). The Meganyctiphanes norvegica LDH-A*4 and LDH-B*4 isoenzymes and the predominant LDH-A*4 isoenzyme from Euphausia superba were purified to specific activities of 294, 306 and 464 μmol NADH min−1 mg−1, respectively. In both species the LDH isoenzymes were separated by chromatofocusing. All three isoenzymes are l-specific tetramers with molecular weight of approximately 160 kDa. Northern krill LDH-A*4 has higher affinity for pyruvate and lactate and is more thermostable than LDH-B*4. Both isoenzymes are inhibited significantly by high concentration of pyruvate but not lactate. Antarctic krill isoenzyme exhibits high substrate affinities, high NAD inhibition, high inhibition at 10 mM pyruvate, lack of lactate inhibition, and high heat stability and resembles northern krill LDH-A*4 isoenzyme.},

	abstract = {In upwelling ecosystems, there is often a crucial intermediate trophic level, occupied by small, plankton-feeding pelagic fish dominated by one or a few schooling species. Their massive populations may vary radically in size under intensive exploitation. We have used decadal-scale time series to explore patterns of interactions between these fish, their prey, and their predators so as to quantify functional roles of small pelagic fish in those ecosystems. Top-down control of zooplankton is detected off South Africa, Ghana, Japan, and in the Black Sea. Conversely, bottom-up control of predators, such as predatory fish and marine birds, is observed in the Benguela, Guinea, and Humboldt currents. Thus small pelagic fish exert a major control on the trophic dynamics of upwelling ecosystems and constitute midtrophic-level “wasp-waist” populations. Ecosystem effects of fishing are addressed by considering potential structural changes at different scales of observation, ranging from individuals, via school dynamics, to food webs. The overall impact is explored using a trophic model (Ecosim) given different types of food web control. Ecosystem dynamics can be entirely different depending on how the food web is controlled (bottom-up, top-down or wasp-waist). The threat of eroding intra-specific diversity is emphasized because it may lead to a long-term decline in the productivity of the pelagic fish resources. School composition is shown to reflect the relative species abundance within the pelagic community and functions as a “school trap” that could maintain a collapsed population in a depleted state for lengthy periods, and affect spatial dynamics such as migrations. As a result, overfishing can alter the abundance, composition, and distribution in pelagic communities, and may induce drastic changes of state. Predation on zooplankton by the jack mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus murphyi) population in the South Pacific provides an example of the alteration of matter fluxes in trophic webs caused by fishery removals. In conclusion, it is doubtful that pelagic fisheries will continue to increase without major disruptions to ecosystems.},

Following spawning, there was a regression of the female copulatory organ, the thelycum, coupled with a decrease in body length and an increase in the krill's mean intermoult period. This was followed by a period of sexual re-maturation, associated with positive growth and a decrease in the mean intermoult period.

	volume = {24},
	issn = {0172-780X},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The pineal gland transduces photoperiodic informations to the neuroendocrine axis through the nocturnally melatonin secretion. This hormonal message plays a major role in the biological rhythm regulation. By autoradiography, more than 130 melatonin putative targets have been reported in the central nervous system (CNS) and in peripheral tissues. However, cross-species consensus concern only a few of them like the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the master circadian clock, and the pars tuberalis of the pituitary. Recently, MT1 melatonin receptor cDNA have been cloned in several mammals providing us with new tools to investigate its tissular location at the gene level. In the present study, we report a screening for MT1 mRNA by RT-PCR amplification of numerous tissue mRNA.
METHOD: mRNA were extracted from a large variety of rat tissues. To semi-quantify the melatonin receptor mRNA expression level, each cDNA was amplified concomitantly with both beta-actin and MT1 specific primers.
RESULTS: In central and peripheral tissues previously reported to bind melatonin, strong PCR signals were logically observed. More surprisingly, a vast majority of studied tissues express MT1 mRNA and then might be responsive to melatonin.
CONCLUSION: Numerous biological functions express diurnal rhythmicity and internal-synchronization. As, most of them apparently do not receive any out-coming neuronal message from the SCN, endocrine communication was proposed to support biological rhythm synchronization. Our present data strengthen the idea that the nocturnally restricted melatonin secretion could be one internal zeitgeber that putatively distributes the endogenous circadian rhythmicity to all tissues expressing melatonin receptors.},

	abstract = {Kongsfjorden and the West Spitsbergen Shelf is a region whose seasonal hydrography is dominated by the balance of Atlantic Water, Arctic waters, and glacial melt. Regional seasonality and the cross-shelf exchange processes have been investigated using conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) observations from 2000–2003 and a 5-month mooring deployment through the spring and summer of 2002. Modeling of shelf-fjord dynamics was performed with the Bergen Ocean Model. Observations show a rapid and overwhelming intrusion of Atlantic Water across the shelf and into the fjord during midsummer giving rise to intense seasonality. Pockets of Atlantic Water, from the West Spitsbergen Current, form through barotropic instabilities at the shelf front. These leak onto the shelf and propagate as topographically steered features toward the fjord. Model results indicate that such cross-front exchange is enhanced by north winds. Normally, Atlantic Water penetration into the fjord is inhibited by a density front at the fjord mouth. This geostrophic control mechanism is found to be more important than the hydraulic control common to many fjords. Slow modification of the fjord water during spring reduces the effectiveness of geostrophic control, and by midsummer, Atlantic Water intrudes into the fjord, switching from being Arctic dominant to Atlantic dominant. Atlantic Water continues to intrude throughout the summer and by September reaches some quasi steady state condition. The fjord adopts a “cold” or “warm” mode according to the degree of Atlantic Water occupation. Horizontal exchange across the shelf may be an important process causing seasonal variability in the northward heat transport to the Arctic.},

In order to relate top predators to other components of the ecosystem studied simultaneously, their distribution is mainly described in terms of energy flow. Bird, seal, and probably also whale requirements were highest in ice-covered areas. There was no evidence of higher numbers of top predators along the ice edge: densities generally increased further into the ice. In the pack ice, combined energy requirements of top predators often amounted to about 200.000 kJ/day/km2, or about 45 kg fresh food, indicating high abundance and availability of prey under the ice. There was a lack of conformity between top predator abundance on the ice and abundance of other life in the water column below. In open water, bird requirements were generally less than 25.000 kJ/day/km2, seals were virtually absent and whales were distributed unevenly. Tubenosed birds concentrated along the outer ice edge in early summer but they moved north to open water during December, leaving the area of maximum phytoplankton biomass associated with the retreating ice edge. This pattern matched northward movements of krill swarms that may be related to changes in quality rather than quantity of phytoplankton stocks.},

	abstract = {Climate scientists have concluded that stratospheric ozone depletion has been a major driver of Southern Hemisphere climate processes since about 1980. The implications of these observed and modelled changes in climate are likely to be far more pervasive for both terrestrial and marine ecosystems than the increase in ultraviolet-B radiation due to ozone depletion; however, they have been largely overlooked in the biological literature. Here, we synthesize the current understanding of how ozone depletion has impacted Southern Hemisphere climate and highlight the relatively few documented impacts on terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Reviewing the climate literature, we present examples of how ozone depletion changes atmospheric and oceanic circulation, with an emphasis on how these alterations in the physical climate system affect Southern Hemisphere weather, especially over the summer season (December-February). These potentially include increased incidence of extreme events, resulting in costly floods, drought, wildfires and serious environmental damage. The ecosystem impacts documented so far include changes to growth rates of South American and New Zealand trees, decreased growth of Antarctic mosses and changing biodiversity in Antarctic lakes. The objective of this synthesis was to stimulate the ecological community to look beyond ultraviolet-B radiation when considering the impacts of ozone depletion. Such widespread changes in Southern Hemisphere climate are likely to have had as much or more impact on natural ecosystems and food production over the past few decades, than the increased ultraviolet radiation due to ozone depletion},

Here we use flight simulator studies to show that migrants indeed possess an inclination magnetic compass to help direct their flight equatorward in the fall. The use of this inclination compass is light-dependent utilizing ultraviolet-A/blue light between 380 and 420 nm. Notably, the significance of light {\textless}420 nm for inclination compass function was not considered in previous monarch studies. The antennae are important for the inclination compass because they appear to contain light-sensitive magnetosensors. For migratory monarchs, the inclination compass may serve as an important orientation mechanism when directional daylight cues are unavailable and may also augment time-compensated sun compass orientation for appropriate directionality throughout the migration.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2156-12-32},
	abstract = {Background: Southern Ocean fauna represent a significant amount of global biodiversity, whose origin may be linked to glacial cycles determining local extinction/eradication with ice advance, survival of refugee populations and post-glacial re-colonization. This pattern implies high potential for differentiation in benthic shelf species with limited dispersal, yet consequences for pelagic organisms are less clear. The present study investigates levels of genetic variation and population structure of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba using mitochondrial DNA and EST-linked microsatellite markers for an unprecedentedly comprehensive sampling of its populations over a circum-Antarctic range. Results: MtDNA (ND1) sequences and EST-linked microsatellite markers indicated no clear sign of genetic structure among populations over large geographic scales, despite considerable power to detect differences inferred from forward-time simulations. Based on ND1, few instances of genetic heterogeneity, not significant after correction for multiple tests, were detected between geographic or temporal samples. Neutrality tests and mismatch distribution based on mtDNA sequences revealed strong evidence of past population expansion. Significant positive values of the parameter g (a measure of population growth) were obtained from microsatellite markers using a coalescent-based genealogical method and suggested a recent start (60 000 - 40 000 years ago) for the expansion. Conclusions: The results provide evidence of lack of genetic heterogeneity of Antarctic krill at large geographic scales and unequivocal support for recent population expansion. Lack of genetic structuring likely reflects the tight link between krill and circum-Antarctic ocean currents and is consistent with the hypothesis that differentiation processes in Antarctic species are largely influenced by dispersal potential, whereas small-scale spatial and temporal differentiation might be due to local conditions leading to genetic patchiness. The signal of recent population growth suggests differential impact of glacial cycles on pelagic Antarctic species, which experienced population expansion during glaciations with increased available habitat, versus sedentary benthic shelf species. EST-linked microsatellites provide new perspectives to complement the results based on mtDNA and suggest that data-mining of EST libraries will be a useful approach to facilitate use of microsatellites for additional species.},

Our estimates are based on historical data not previously available, additional modern data, and bathythermograph data corrected for instrumental biases. We have also used Argo data corrected by the Argo DAC if available and used uncorrected Argo data if no corrections were available at the time we downloaded the Argo data. The heat content of the World Ocean for the 0-2000 m layer increased by 24.0  1.9  1022 J(2S.E.) corresponding toarateof0.39Wm?2 (per unit area of the World Ocean) and a volume mean warming of 0.09C. This warming corresponds toarateof0.27Wm?2 per unit area of earthssurface.The heat content of the World Ocean for the 0-700 m layer increased by 16.7  1.6  1022 J corresponding to a rate of 0.27 W m?2 (per unit area of the World Ocean) and a volume mean warming of 0.18C. The World Ocean accounts for approximately 93\% of the warming of the earth system that has occurred since 1955. The 700-2000 m ocean layer accounted for approximately one-third of the warming of the 0-2000 m layer of the World Ocean. The thermosteric component of sea level trend was 0.54  .05 mm yr?1 for the 0-2000 m layer and 0.41  .04 mm yr},

	abstract = {Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is preeminently a gregarious animal. It lives for almost the whole of its existence from the late furcilia stage in aggregations. Despite this, laboratory study of schooling and swarming behav- iour has been seriously neglected and critical emergent properties of group dynamics may have been overlooked. Using different-sized groups of gregarious mysids, I show that weight-specific oxygen uptake is reduced by about seven times when they form cohesive aggregations compared with when they are in uncohesive small groups. If this is true for E. superba, it casts doubt on all previous measurements of metabolic rate and suggests that estimates of the metabolic cost of swimming and perhaps feeding are much too high. The reason that groups conserve energy compared with isolates or small groups is hypothesised to be at least partly due to hydrodynamic processes, which serve to mini- mise sinking rates. Dye plumes revealed updrafts generated by mysid swarms, which could be exploited by individuals to reduce their sinking rate. These circulation patterns might also increase the efficiency of particle capture by aggrega- tions. I propose that aggregation in aquatic crustaceans is a strategy to optimise energy expenditure and maximise food capture. Measuring behavioural and physiological rate processes in isolated animals will produce only artifacts.},

	abstract = {A frequency domain singular value decomposition is performed on 20 years (1979–1998) of monthly sea ice concentration, sea ice drift and sea level pressure data in the Weddell Sea, Antarctica. Interannual oscillations with periods of around 3–4 years are found to dominate the variability in this region. Anomalous atmospheric patterns periodically reach the Weddell Sea from the west and perturb the sea ice circulation and distribution in the Weddell Gyre through changes in the intensity and direction of the climatological winds. Sea ice accumulates in the southeastern Weddell Sea every 3–4 years owing to two atmospherically driven processes: (1) weak ice export to the north due to a weak northward branch of the gyre (driven by weak southerly winds) and (2) large ice import from the east due to a strong East Wind Drift (driven by strong easterly winds along the coast). The opposite situation gives rise to a depletion of sea ice in the same region half a cycle later. Sea ice anomalies are then advected north-northeastward before turning eastward in the gyre circulation. The eastward propagation of ice anomalies along the ice margin accounts for the passage of the Antarctic Circumpolar Wave through the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. A low frequency signal is also detected in the Weddell Sea variations, albeit rather speculatively in this 20-year-long record. Sea ice variability on this timescale appears to be associated with a change in the shape and characteristics of the Weddell Gyre circulation around 1990. This mode of variability implicates feedbacks between the gyre and Weddell Deep Water temperature variations, whose impact is observed near the Maud Rise topographic feature.},

	abstract = {In the digestive gland (liver) of Trinchesia granosa (Schmekel, 1966) four cell types, called A-, B-, C- and D-cells can be distinguished by light and electron microscopic investigations, supported by living observations as well as feeding and starving experiments. The A-cells (undifferentiated epithelium cells) mostly are found at the base of the liver epithelium. Their cytoplasm is rich of free ribosomes. The endoplasmic reticulum is barely developed. Special differentiations inside the cells, e.g. vacuoles, granules or at the cell surface, e.g. microvilli, cilia are not present. The B-cells (digestive cells) always line the lumen of the liver with broad surface. The apical plasmalemma forms small, scattered microvilli and a few cilia. Food vacuoles of varying size and content as well as apical pinocytotic vesicles are regularly found. The cytoplasm contains a scarcely developed endoplasmic reticulum, lipoid droplets and a Golgiapparatus with characteristic osmiophilic aggregates. The C-cells (secretory cells) do not always reach the lumen of the liver. The striking basophilia of the C-cells is based on a strongly developed granular endoplasmic reticulum. In the cytoplasm are found many Golgi-zones and large vacuoles with a weak osmiophilic body, being described in detail. Microvilli can be differentiated, cilia are absent. The D-cells (excretory cells) can be distinguished already in the living animal by many dark-brown granulated vacuoles. Electron micrographs show these vacuoles containing one or more osmiophilic particles of varying size and several vesicles. Mature D-cells contain very little cytoplasm. The brushborder is well developed, consisting of long, tightly packed microvilli, branching and forming a narrow mashed net. Cilia are absent. Considering observations of living animals, feeding and starving experiments, we offer the following interpretation: The A-cells are undifferentiated or embryonic cells of the liver epithelium. The B-cells are digestive cells, taking up food materials by means of phagocytosis and pinocytosis and digesting it intracellulary. We suggest that the C-cells mainly have secretory functions and eventually may store excretory products. The D-cells serve for excretion and storage of excretory products, and have also resorptive capacities, e.g. for water and water soluble substances. Investigations on hatching and adult animals indicate that the three mature cell types are individual types and do not change from the one form into the other. Aspects of comparative cytology of the digestive glands of Nudibranchiata are discussed.},

Data were from the Indian, Pacific and western Atlantic sectors. In early summer (December) high density concentrations of krill frequently occurred in the vicinity of southerly positioned pack-ice edges and in the embayments surrounded by the pack-ice edge. In mid and late summer (January-March) when the ice-edge was at its southern-most limit, krill fishing data indicated that harvestable areas were associated with the continental and insular shelf breaks, not with the pack-ice edge. Minke whaling data also suggested that not only sea-ice but also topographical features such as the continental shelf breaks and banks may be important factors affecting minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostratci) distribution. Krill harvesting areas in the vicinity of the shelf breaks were often coincident with hydrographic fronts. These results suggested that hydrographic features caused by uneven bottom topography (e. g. shelf breaks or banks) may induce the formation of krill concentrations in mid and late summer. The extremely high concentration of minke whales and their food composition suggested the high abundance of E. superba around a bank on the Ross Sea shelf.},

Vegetable detritus of land and coastal origin is of notable importance as a source of food, especially to those specimens measuring 21-29 mm., which is the most abundant size found in the Clyde Sea Area.2. Meganyctiphanes in the Clyde Sea Area for the most part lives and feeds between 10 and 20 fathoms above a muddy bottom, usually in waters about 60-80 fathoms deep.3. Meganyctiphanes feeds by selecting from the surrounding water the suspended micro-organisms and detritus, and would thus come under the category of a “suspension feeder.”4. The larger specimens measuring 29-31 mm. are found chiefly in Upper Loch Fyne. The largest specimens measuring 37 mm. are found exclusively in Upper Loch Fyne.5. Adult specimens tend to decrease in numbers from May till September. During these months they appear to live during the day immediately above or on the muddy bottom.6. The association of Meganyctijihanes norvegica, Thysanoessa raschii, Euchceta norvegica, and Calanus finmarchicus, in large numbers in Upper Loch Fyne would indicate that conditions there are specially favourable to all these species.7. In Upper Loch Fyne M. norvegica, T. raschii, E. norvegica, and C. finmarchicus, make partial vertical diurnal migrations, specimens being found a few fathoms from the bottom during both day and night.8. Under certain circumstances light appears to have a harmful effect on M. norvegica.},

	abstract = {A one-dimensional, temperature-dependent model is implemented to simulate the descentascent cycle of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) embryos and larvae. Inputs to the model are monthly mean climatologies of ambient temperature and density fields obtained from the World Ocean Atlas Database for Southern Ocean waters. Simulations are done with a 1$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$ resolution at a circumpolar scale, south of 60$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$S, and the results are interpolated to a 5 grid to match the resolution of the bottom bathymetry data. Simulations of the descentascent cycle using environmental conditions corresponding to the Antarctic krill spawning season (DecemberMarch) resulted in unconstrained success in completion of the cycle in water deeper than 1000\&\#xa0;m. Continental shelf regions favorable to successful hatching of Antarctic krill embryos are limited to areas along the west Antarctic Peninsula, large areas in the Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas, offshore of Wilkes Land, and to the east and west of Prydz Bay. These are regions where the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front is along the shelf slope, the Antarctic Slope Front is absent, and Circumpolar Deep Water is present. The effect of seasonal variability in temperature on the descentascent cycle tends to enhance the probability of success in regions offshore of Wilkes Land, Queen Maud Land, and the eastern shelf of the Antarctic Peninsula later in the spawning season. The simulations show that success of the descentascent cycle is sensitive to initial embryo diameter and larval ascent rate. Initial embryo diameter may provide an additional constraint on success of the descentascent cycle, especially in continental shelf waters, where small embryos tend to encounter the bottom before hatching. The circumpolar distributions of simulated embryo hatching depth and larval success show that all regions of the Antarctic are not equal in the ability to support successful completion of the Antarctic krill descentascent cycle, which has implications for the overall circum-Antarctic krill distribution and for the development of nutrient and material budgets, especially for Antarctic continental shelf areas.},

Most species of krill are open ocean animals, which makes direct observation and sampling difficult. Krill also exhibit a number of physiological and behavioural attributes which frustrate attempts to understand their life history. Krill are conceptually difficult to come to terms with; they are obviously different from larger marine organisms such as squid, fish, whales and fish yet they are also quite distinct from those animals classed as zooplankton such as copepods. Despite these differences they have most often been grouped with zooplankton and have been studied using techniques developed for animals which are orders of magnitude smaller than they. This mismatch has affected our view of their interactions with the physical world and also affects their perceived trophic interactions. Their size and mobility also interferes with our ability to sample them effectively and thus to develop our appreciation of their true role in the marine ecosystem. Understanding how intermediate-sized animals, such as krill, function in aquatic ecosystem is critical to better management of the marine environment.},

	abstract = {Climate change effects on marine ecosystems involve various stressors, pre domi- nantly temperature, hypoxia and CO2, all of which may combine with further anthropogenic stressors such as pollutants. All life forms respond to these drivers, following potentially common principles, which are insufficiently understood. Specific understanding may be most advanced in animals where the concept of oxygen and capacity dependent thermal tolerance (OCLTT) is anintegrator of various effects, linking molecular to ecosystem levels of biological organisation. Recent studies confirm OCLTT involvement in the field, causing changes in spe-cies abundance, biogeographical ranges, phenology and species predominance. At the whole-animal level, performance capacity set by aerobic scope and energy budget, building on base-line energy turnover, links fitness (within a thermal window) and functioning at the ecosystem level. In variable environments like the intertidal zone, animals also exploit their capacity for passive tolerance. While presently the temperature signal appears predominant in the field, effects may well involve other stressors, acting synergistically by narrowing the aerobic OCLTT window. Recent findings support the OCLTT concept as a common physiological basis linking apparently disjunct effects of ocean warming, acidification and hypoxia in a so-called climate syndrome. In brief, warming-induced CO2accumulation in body fluids links to the effects of ocean acidification mediated by the weak acid distribution of CO2. Temperature-induced hypoxemia links to the hypoxia sensitivity of thermal tolerance. Future work will need to develop proxies for the temperature-dependent effects of climate-related stressors and also identify the principles operative in organisms other than animals and their underlying mecha-nisms. Mechanism-based modelling efforts are then needed to develop reliable organism to eco-system projections of future change.},

This article briefly describes the ship and outlines the scientific programme, which involved 137 scientists and technicians from 12 German and 16 non-German institutions. In the cruise of 27 June–17 September research was centred on physical and chemical investigations of the structure and dynamics of water, ice and lower atmosphere, including growth and movement of the icefield. The ship penetrated almost to the coast of Dronning Maud Land, failing, however, to find the Weddell Polynya which had appeared on satellite imagery in 1976–78. The cruise of 28 September–14 December added biological investigations to the programme; crossing the main body of pack ice to investigate the eastern coastal polynya, the biology of sea ice, plankton, fish and bottom fauna, and the breeding and feeding of seals and penguins were investigated. Use was made of a field station established on the mainland ice cliff. Helicopters extended the range of the work on both cruises.},

	abstract = {The biomass of Calanus spp. in the Norwegian Atlantic Current and the West Spitsbergen Current (2001–2009) was statistically related to a combination of salinity, temperature, water depth and sea ice concentration. The aim of this study was to identify the significance of these environmental factors for controlling the species-specific biomass distribution and the nature of such relationships. Calanus finmarchicus dominated the entire area and its biomass was mainly related to salinity. Calanus glacialis was mainly found along the northwest shelf of the Barents Sea, but its biomass was also related to the sea ice concentration and temperature with a critical threshold ∼6°C, above which the presence and biomass of C. glacialis decreased. The Calanus hyperboreus biomass was related to all environmental factors, which characterized by a confined spatial distribution to water associated with the Greenland Sea Gyre. We conclude that C. hyperboreus is an expatriate to the study area. The Calanus biomass distribution will not change greatly in the study area with an expected increase of water temperature by 2°C, whereas the critical temperature threshold for C. glacialis will be exceeded with temperature increases of ∼4°C with a likely disappearance of this cold water species from the north-west shelf of the Barents Sea.},

This practice is being questioned as it becomes increasingly clear that some housekeeping genes may vary considerably in certain biological samples. We used real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to assess the levels of 13 housekeeping genes expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cell culture and whole blood from healthy individuals and those with tuberculosis. Housekeeping genes were selected from conventionally used ones and from genes reported to be invariant in hu-man T cell culture. None of the commonly used housekeeping genes [e.g., glyceraldehyde-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GAPDH)] were found to be suitable as internal references, as they were highly variable ({\textgreater}30-fold maximal variability). Furthermore, genes previously found to be invariant in human T cell culture also showed large variation in RNA expression ({\textgreater}34-fold maximal vari-ability). Genes that were invariant in blood were highly variable in peripheral blood mononuclear cell culture. Our data show that RNA specifying human acidic ribosomal protein was the most suitable housekeeping gene for normalizing mRNA levels in human pulmonary tuberculosis. Validations of housekeeping genes are highly specific for a particular experimental model and are a cru-cial component in assessing any new model.},

Water, protein and copper concentrations all decreased following ecdysis and increased again towards the end of the moult cycle. The major ions sodium and potassium fluctuated around mean levels. Cast moults of E. superba were shown to be a drain on the ionic load of the krill, and the losses inherent in exuviation could account for much of the variation observed during the moult cycle.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: The trophic relationships of both the benthic and pelagic communities in the Estuary and Gulf of St Lawrence regions were examined, with a special focus on the trophic position (TP) and relationship(s) among harbour, grey, hooded and harp seals and beluga whales. A multiple stable isotope and multiple tissue approach, used in conjunction with conventional dietary information, suggested that marine mammals occupied the highest trophic positions in the food webs of both communities and that they overlapped with one another to some extent trophically. Harbour seals Phoca vitulina and hooded seals Cystophora cristata occupied the highest TP, grey seals Halichoerus grypus, Gulf harp seals Phoca groenlandica, and male beluga whales Delphinapterus leucas were intermediate, and Estuary harp seals and female beluga whales were at the lowest TP. A general pattern of increasing enrichment of 13C or 15N with age was observed in marine mammals (as well as fishes), although yearlings showed a decreased enrichment compared to both younger and older age classes. Sex also influenced δ15N values. Males were more 15N-enriched than females, with the difference between the sexes increasing with age, and being most pronounced in species that are sexually dimorphic with respect to body size. Geographical location also influenced isotope abundance. Estuary organisms were generally 13C-enriched relative to Gulf animals. δ13C values were on average lower in short-term diet integrators (blood serum) than in longer-term diet integrators (red blood cells) of harbour seals captured in April to June in the Estuary, which suggests that they probably did not move outside the Lower Estuary during the winter. Grey seals captured in the Lower Estuary did, however, show evidence of having been in the Gulf region some weeks or months before capture.},

	abstract = {Research on the thermal biology of Antarctic marine organisms has increased awareness of their vulnerability to climate change, as a flipside of their adaptation to life in the permanent cold and their limited capacity to acclimate to variable temperatures. Here, we employed a species-specific microarray of the Antarctic eelpout, Pachycara brachycephalum, to identify long-term shifts in gene expression after 2 months of acclimation to six temperatures between −1 and 9 °C. Changes in cellular processes comprised signalling, post-translational modification, cytoskeleton remodelling, metabolic shifts and alterations in the transcription as well as translation machinery. The magnitude of transcriptomic responses paralleled the change in whole animal performance. Optimal growth at 3 °C occurred at a minimum in gene expression changes indicative of a balanced steady state. The up-regulation of ribosomal transcripts at 5 °C and above was accompanied by the transcriptomic activation of differential protein degradation pathways, from proteasome-based degradation in the cold towards lysosomal protein degradation in the warmth. From 7 °C upwards, increasing transcript levels representing heat-shock proteins and an acute inflammatory response indicate cellular stress. Such patterns may contribute to a warm-induced energy deficit and a strong weight loss at temperatures above 6 °C. Together, cold or warm acclimation led to specific cellular rearrangements and the progressive development of functional imbalances beyond the optimum temperature. The observed temperature-specific expression profiles reveal the molecular basis of thermal plasticity and refine present understanding of the shape and positioning of the thermal performance curve of ectotherms on the temperature scale.},

	abstract = {Melatonin, the chief secretory product of the vertebrate pineal gland is suspected to be a ubiquitous molecule principally involved in the transduction of photoperiodic information. Besides vertebrates, melatonin has been detected throughout phylogeny in numerous non-vertebrate taxa. In the present study, the occurrence of melatonin in Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and its possible role in mediating seasonal metabolic changes was evaluated. Melatonin was quantified by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purified extracts of eyestalks and hemolymph of krill sampled in the Lazarev Sea during the Antarctic winter and summer. In addition, oxygen uptake rates and the activities of the metabolic enzyme malate dehydrogenase (MDH) were recorded to assess the metabolic status of krill. Validation of melatonin measurements was carried out on the basis of three different extraction methods with parallel determination of melatonin by ELISA in crude extracts and in HPLC purified extracts, and after derivatization of melatonin under alkaline conditions in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. A significantly higher respiration rate and MDH activity was found in summer krill than in winter krill indicating that krill was in a state of reduced metabolic activity during winter. However, neither during winter nor during summer there were detectable melatonin concentrations in the visual system or hemolymph of krill. Based on these results, we question a mediating role of melatonin in the control of seasonal metabolic changes in Antarctic krill.},

PREFACE
The main topic of the symposium “Biological Clocks” says nothing about the types of clocks we will be concerned with. It is an open question whether the clocks run continuously or stop after one revolution and have to be started anew. Also the term “clock” does not imply that one revolution is finished in 24 hours. Watches are instruments to measure time. Organisms have to measure time-spans of quite different lengths and for different purposes. Each measurement of speed, for instance, needs timing and mostly within the limits of milliseconds. One can expect, therefore, that organisms possess several clocks with perhaps extremely different periods [1]. There is no need for these clocks to run continuously; for some purposes it would be sufficient if the clock were started always at the beginning of timing (principle of a sandglass, stop watch). “Biological clocks” therefore is a more general concept than what...},

Ecologists have focused on propagule pressure (for example, the number of individuals and invasion events), the characteristics of an invading species, and its new abiotic and biotic environment to predict the likelihood of range expansion and invasion. Here, we emphasize the role of photoperiodic response on the range expansion of species. Unlike temperature, the latitudinal gradient of seasonal changes in day length is a stable, abiotic environmental factor that does not change with local or global climate. Predicting range expansions across latitudes and the subsequent consequences for native communities requires a more comprehensive understanding of how species use day length to coordinate seasonal growth, reproduction, physiology and synchronization of life cycles with interacting individuals and species.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Salps are bloom-forming, pelagic tunicates with high grazing rates on phytoplankton, with the potential to greatly increase vertical particle flux through rapidly sinking fecal pellets. However, the frequency and causes of salp blooms are not well known. We quantified salps from day and night zooplankton net tows in the epipelagic zone of the North Atlantic subtropical gyre as part of the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS). Salp species and size were quantified in biweekly to monthly tows from April 1994 to November 2011. Twenty-one species of salps occurred at the BATS site over this time period, and the most common bloom-forming salps were Thalia democratica, Salpa fusiformis, Weelia (Salpa) cylindrica, Cyclosalpa polae, and Iasis zonaria. Five species of salps exhibited diel vertical migration, and salp abundances varied seasonally, with T. democratica, S. fusiformis, and C. polae blooms coincident with the spring phytoplankton bloom, and W. cylindrica blooms occurring more often in late summer. For T. democratica, mean annual biomass increased slightly over the time series and was elevated every 3 yr, and biomass increased in the presence of cyclonic mesoscale eddies. Decadal climate oscillations and biogeochemical conditions influenced multi-year trends in salp abundance and biomass. Both total salp and T. democratica abundance were positively correlated with primary production, total salp biomass was positively correlated with the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, and T. democratica biomass was negatively correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. These salp bloom dynamics have important implications for planktonic food web interactions and biogeochemical cycling.},

Cytochrome oxidase and NADH dehydrogenase (nuclear and mitochondrial encoded, cristae location) increased to a lesser extent and with a pattern dissimilar to the first group. Northern blots and activity of succinate dehydrogenase (cristae location but entirely nuclear encoded) suggested the groupings were based on location of the genes rather than the mature enzyme. However, quantitative electron microscopy and comparisons with adult tissue suggested that mitochondrial ultrastructure can influence the change in cristae enzymes. Cristae surface area per unit mitochondrial volume and per unit cell volume increased much less than did cristae enzymes. Available space on the inner membrane may become limiting and account for some aspects of the pattern of change in electron transport enzymes during differentiation},

	abstract = {A hydroacoustic survey was conducted in the waters off East Antarctica (CCAMLR Division 58.4.1) during January to March 1996 to estimate the biomass (B0) of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). The krill biomass in the area surveyed (872,500 km2) was estimated to be 4.83 million tonnes with a CV of 17\%. Dense aggregations of krill, although encountered infrequently, dominated the biomass estimate. At least 97\% of these aggregations were less than 200 m in transected length, and the largest was 1 100 m. Large clusters of aggregations (\&gt;1 km in transected length) were encountered on 4 of the 18 transects, and these dominated the krill biomass encountered during the survey. Krill were more abundant, with a broader latitudinal distribution, in the west of the survey area (80–115°E) than in the east (115–150°E). The absence of krill and the presence of warmer oceanic waters characterized the northeastern sector of the surveyed area. Krill aggregations were most frequently encountered in the shelf break region where the summer ice edge, 1000 m isobath, and the Antarctic Slope Front (ASF) (associated with the cooler coastal and warmer oceanic waters) coincided. The majority of krill aggregations were found in the top 100 m of the water column, and when deeper (\&gt;100 m) aggregations occurred they were usually coincident with aggregations in the top 100 m. The mean krill density for the area surveyed was 5.54 g m−2, consistent with previous observations that the Indian Ocean sector is relatively impoverished when compared with krill density values for the South Atlantic. This density is at the low end of the range of values reported for surveys around South Georgia, Elephant Island, and the adjacent Prydz Bay region. However, this low average biomass results from averaging over a few krill-rich areas with large areas where krill is scarce or absent.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: A time-dependent, size-structured, bioenergetically based model was developed to examine the growth dynamics of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba 2 to 60 mm in size. The metabolic processes included in the model are ingestion, a baseline respiration, respiratory losses due to feeding and digestion, and an activity-based respiration factor. The total of these processes, net production, was used as the basis for determining the growth or shrinkage of individuals. Size-dependent parameterizations for the metabolic processes were constructed from field and laboratory measurements. Environmental effects were included through time series of pelagic phytoplankton concentration that were derived from data sets collected west of the Antarctic Peninsula. Simulated growth rates during the spring and summer for all krill size classes were consistent with published growth rates; however, initial results indcated that winter shrinkage rates were too large. Although the use of a seasonally varying respiration activlty factor (reduced winter respiration rates) resulted in winter shrinkage rates of adults that were consistent with observations of experimentally starved {\textasciitilde}ndividualst,h e annual change In length of specific size classes was stffl inconsistent wth observations. Subsequent simulations examined the effect of ingestion of sea ice algae by krill in the late winter and early spring. The annual growth cycle best matched observations, particularly those for larval and subadult krill ({\textless}35 mm), when reduced winter respiration rates and ingestion of sea ice algae were both included. These results suggest that the ability of krill to exploit a range of food sources and reduced winter metabolism rates are the mechanisms that allow krill to successfully overwinter. The need for additional observations of krill physiological processes, especially during winter, is clearly indicated.},

Seasonally breeding mammals use the annual change in the photoperiod cycle to drive rhythmic nocturnal melatonin signals from the pineal gland, providing a critical cue to time seasonal reproduction [1]. Paradoxically, species resident at high latitudes achieve tight regulation of the temporal pattern of growth and reproduction despite the absence of photoperiodic information for most of the year [2]. In this study, we show that the melatonin rhythm of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) is acutely responsive to the light/dark cycle but not to circadian phase, and also that two key clock genes monitored in reindeer fibroblast cells display little, if any, circadian rhythmicity. The molecular clockwork that normally drives cellular circadian rhythms is evidently weak or even absent in this species, and instead, melatonin-mediated seasonal timing may be driven directly by photic information received at a limited time of year specific to the equinoxes.},

	abstract = {Adjustments in mitochondrial properties and capacities are crucial in acclimatization to seasonal cold as well as in evolutionary cold adaptation of marine ectotherms. To examine whether gene expression mechanisms contribute to different settings of aerobic capacities in populations of cod (Gadus morhua) along a latitudinal cline, maximum activities of key enzymes of mitochondrial metabolism and their respective mRNA levels were compared in white muscle and liver of cold (4°C) and warm (10°C) acclimated individuals from cod populations of the North Sea and the Barents Sea, respectively. In white muscle, cold acclimation caused a parallel increase in citrate synthase (CS) and in cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activities, but with a much larger effect in the cold eurythermal Arctic population. In liver, cold acclimation was accompanied by increments in CS activities, but differences between populations were minor. Overall COX activities in liver were not affected by cold acclimation, but were higher in the cold adapted population. In both populations increments in muscle CS capacities were tightly correlated with elevated mRNA levels, suggesting transcriptional control of citrate synthase levels in muscle. In liver, CS mRNA levels differed between populations but were not affected by cold acclimation, so that post-transcriptional control may contribute to elevated functional levels in this tissue. Mitochondrial-encoded COX2 mRNA levels were not limiting for functional activities in both tissues, in favour of post-transcriptional control or limitations by other transcripts of the COX complex. Altogether, the differentiation in gene expression between both populations was more strongly expressed at 4°C. The comparison of functional levels and transcript levels may reflect genetic differentiation at functional sites, in line with genetic differences between the two populations previously established by non-coding genetic markers.},

	abstract = {Oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion were measured simultaneously in 25 individual shrimps (C. crangon) every two days during a 30-day imposed starvation. The first response to starvation was a 10\% decrease in O2 consumption and a 25\% decrease in ammonia excretion. Following this, O2 consumption decreased sharply while ammonia excretion tended to rise. From the 14th day until the end of the experiment, the rates of each remained steady, the respiratory rate being about 60\% below and rate of excretion about 30\% above control values. From the O:N ratio it appeared that carbohydrate reserves were quickly exhausted (3–4 days) and that lipids and proteins were the main substrates oxidized to meet the energetic requirements ofC. crangon. After 2 weeks of starvation the O:N ratio remained constant near a value of 8, indicating that only proteins were being utilised; a 50\% loss of body protein after 30 days suggested that structural proteins were heavily catabolized. The meatabolic response ofCrangon to starvation (although seasonal variations must be considered) appears to depend mainly on high nitrogen requirements.},

Moving from correlations with environmental parameters to an understanding of the mechanisms that lead to these correlations may allow predictions of the consequences of climate change on the distribution of favourable habitat for Antarctic krill. During winter cruises in 2001 and 2002 in the region west of the Antarctic Peninsula, one of the most rapidly warming regions on the planet, ice camps were established for periods of 3-9 days. Timing of sea ice advance, chlorophyllaconcentrations in ice cores, and growth rates and pigment content of larval krill all differed significantly between winters. Growth rates and pigment content of larval krill from the same ice floe were correlated, suggesting that growth rates in winter are a function of the biomass of the sea ice microbial community. Apossible mechanism underlying the correlation between recruitment success and timing of ice advance is proposed. In conjunction with other postulated habitat requirements, this proposed mechanism allows for speculation about future changes in the geographic location of favourable habitat for Antarctic krill.},

	abstract = {Fragilariopsis cylindrus (Grunow) Willi Krieger, a bipolar psychrophilic and highly abundant diatom, experiences strong shifts in salinity during the for-mation of sea ice. We investigated the effects of osmotic stress due to an increased salt concentration from 34 to 70 practical salinity units (PSU) in conjunction with a temperature decrease from 0$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C to )4$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C on the anabolic and catabolic pathways of proline metabolism. Gene expression levels of D1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS) strongly decreased by a factor of 17.3 in the 70 PSU 0$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C treatment, whereas copy numbers of ornithine d-aminotransferase (d-OAT) increased 7.6-fold. Tran-script levels of D1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (P5CR) and proline dehydrogenase (ProDH) were also slightly up-regulated by 2.5 and 2.88, respect-ively. This contrasts with findings in higher plants where a reverse regulation of P5CS and d-OAT was observed and indicates that under elevated external salinities, the ornithine route is preferred to the glu-tamate pathway in F. cylindrus. Photosynthetic quan-tum yield at PSII instantly dropped from 0.61 to 0.24 after the upshift in salinity, which confirmed a detrimental effect of elevated salt concentrations on the photosynthetic machinery. Reduced photosyn-thetic energy capture might explain the preference for the ornithine route over the more energy-consuming proline route. Salt proved to be the dominating stressor, while an additional tempera-ture decrease appeared to have an ameliorating effect.},

	title = {Recent rapid regional climate warming on the {Antarctic} {Peninsula}},
	volume = {60},
	abstract = {The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) confirmed that mean global warming was 0.6 0.2 C during the 20th century and cited anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases as the likely cause of temperature rise in the last 50 years. But this mean value conceals the substantial complexity of observed climate change, which is seasonally- and diurnally-biased, decadally-variable and geographically patchy. In particular, over the last 50 years three high-latitude areas have undergone recent rapid regional (RRR) warming, which was substantially more rapid than the global mean. However, each RRR warming occupies a different climatic regime and may have an entirely different underlying cause. We discuss the significance of RRR warming in one area, the Antarctic Peninsula. Here warming was much more rapid than in the rest of Antarctica where it was not significantly different to the global mean. We highlight climate proxies that appear to show that RRR warming on the Antarctic Peninsula is unprecedented over the last two millennia, and so unlikely to be a natural mode of variability. So while the station records do not indicate a ubiquitous polar amplification of global warming, the RRR warming on the Antarctic Peninsula might be a regional amplification of such warming. This, however, remains unproven since we cannot yet be sure what mechanism leads to such an amplification. We discuss several possible candidate mechanisms: changing oceanographic or changing atmospheric circulation, or a regional air-sea-ice feedback amplifying greenhouse warming. We can show that atmospheric warming and reduction in sea-ice duration coincide in a small area on the west of the Antarctic Peninsula, but here we cannot yet distinguish cause and effect. Thus for the present we cannot determine which process is the probable cause of RRR warming on the Antarctic Peninsula and until the mechanism initiating and sustaining the RRR warming is understood, and is convincingly reproduced in climate models, we lack a sound basis for predicting climate change in this region over the coming century.},

	abstract = {The ribonucleic acid (RNA) content of the krill was measured on specimens collected during the KAIYO-MARU cruise to the Wilkes Land, Antactica, January 1980. Of 41 specimens analysed, the RNA content varied from 2.5 to 8.2\% of body protein (mean: 5.1\%). A higher RNA content was seen in smaller specimens, and the relationship was log Y=-0.34logX+1.27, where Yis the RNA content as percent of protein, and X is the body size as mg protein. Combining this equation with the RNA-growth rate equation of BÅMSTEDT and SKJOLDAL (Limnol. Oceanogr., 25, 304,1980), the growth rate of the krill was estimated to be 0.17-0.19 mm day{\textasciicircum}{\textless}-1{\textgreater} for specimens greater than 30 mm body length. Assuming a favorable feeding period of 6 months in a year for this animal, post-larvae could grow to the final size adults in 201 days. Validity of these results depends on the RNA-growth rate equation. In the light of possible species-specific variation in the RNA-growth rate relationship, this relationship needs to be established for the Antarctic krill in future laboratory experiments.},

	abstract = {Fatty-acid biomarkers are frequently used for the identification of trophic relationships among marine zooplankton. We have evaluated the suitability of five fatty-acid ratios [16:0/16:1(n-7), 16:1(n-7)/18:4(n-3), 18:1(n-9)/18:1(n-7), 20:5(n-3)/22:6(n-3), PUFA/SFA] that have been proposed as trophic indicators in the literature. Total lipid content and fatty-acid composition were determined in four Antarctic euphausiid species (Euphausia superba, E. frigida, E. triacantha, Thysanoessa macrura). There is a significant relationship between the lipid content and most of these ratios in the investigated euphausiids. Only the 16:1(n-7)/18:4(n-3) ratio exhibits no clear relationship to total lipids. Further exceptions occur in E. triacantha: the 18:1(n-9)/18:1(n-7) and the 20:5(n-3)/22:6(n-3) ratios are not correlated to the lipid content in this species. There is a weaker correlation between the fatty-acid ratios and the total lipid content in E. superba larvae than in the postlarvae, indicating a stronger dietary influence on the lipids of the younger stages. We conclude that those fatty-acid ratios that strongly depend on an animal’s total lipid content (particularly PUFA/SFA), are only of limited use as trophic indices, since total lipid content may vary greatly with factors (such as reproductive processes) that are unrelated to specific feeding preferences.},

The base compositions of the 28 S and 18 S rRNAs have been determined.

	abstract = {Paleoclimate data help us assess climate sensitivity and potential human-made climate effects. We conclude that Earth in the warmest interglacial periods of the past million years was less than 1$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C warmer than in the Holocene. Polar warmth in these interglacials and in the Pliocene does not imply that a substantial cushion remains between todays climate and dangerous warming, but rather that Earth is poised to experience strong amplifying polar feedbacks in response to moderate global warming. Thus, goals to limit human-made warming to 2$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C are not sufficientthey are prescriptions for disaster. Ice sheet disintegration is nonlinear, spurred by amplifying feedbacks. We suggest that ice sheet mass loss, if warming continues unabated, will be characterized better by a doubling time for mass loss rate than by a linear trend. Satellite gravity data, though too brief to be conclusive, are consistent with a doubling time of 10 years or less, implying the possibility of multimeter sea level rise this century. Observed accelerating ice sheet mass loss supports our conclusion that Earths temperature now exceeds the mean Holocene value. Rapid reduction of fossil fuel emissions is required for humanity to succeed in preserving a planet resembling the one on which civilization developed.},

A total of 130 individuals (adults: 78, subadults: 49, juveniles: 3) which were caught by krill trawling from various depths were examined in this study. The foregut contents of the krill consisted of various fragments of crustacean zooplankton in 77 individuals out of 130 examined. Among the fragments a portion of the pereiopods of krill was found from all specimens examined. Although the obtained materials were geographically confined to South Georgian waters, which were free from fast ice throughout the year, the results might imply that E. superba seemed to seasonally switch their food source: E. superba demonstrated herbivorous food habits during rich phytoplankton bloom, but might change to carnivorous habits in the fall and winter. Strong cannibalistic food habits during the austral winter as found in this study are considered to be important for the population dynamics of krill.},

	abstract = {Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a keystone species in the southern ocean ecosystem where it is the main consumer of phytoplankton and constitutes the main food item of many higher predators. Both food and predators are most abundant at the surface, thus krill hide in the depth of the ocean during the day and migrate to the upper layers at night, to feed at a time when the predatory risk is lowest. Although the functional significance of this diel vertical migration (DVM) is clear and its modulation by environmental factors has been described, the involvement of an endogenous circadian clock in this behaviour is as yet not fully resolved. We have analysed the circadian behaviour of Euphausia superba in a laboratory setting and here we present the first description of locomotor activity rhythms for this species. Our results are in agreement with the hypothesis that the circadian clock plays a key role in DVM. They also suggest that the interplay between food availability, social cues and the light:dark cycle acts as the predominant Zeitgeber for DVM in this species.},

	abstract = {Herbivorous copepods, especially from polar regions, buffer the pronounced seasonality of primary production through the accumulation of large energy reserves that are deposited as neutral lipids, mainly wax esters but also triacylglycerols. Principal components of these lipids are the long-chain monounsaturated fatty acids and alcohols 20:1(n−9) and 22:1(n−11). Wax ester synthesis based on these compounds is most pronounced in the Arctic copepod, Calanus hyperboreus, but it is also characteristic of the other dominant herbivores, Calanus glacialis and Calanus finmarchicus, as well as for the Antarctic Calanoides acutus. Rhincalanus gigas, another Antarctic species, also fits this scheme of wax ester synthesizers, although its wax esters consist of shorter-chain fatty acids and alcohols. In contrast, the Antarctic Calanus propinguus synthesizes triacylglycerols dominated by the two monounsaturated fatty acid isomers 22: 1(n−11) and 22: 1(n−9). This further elongation of the fatty acids increases their calorific value and may at least partially compensate this species' apparent inability to produce wax esters. Other dominant fatty acids in the lipids of these copepods originate from dietary input and may be used as trophic markers for herbivorous feeding.},

A second aim is to clarify the extent to which seasonal variation in larval and adult krill physiology is mediated by environmental factors with a strong seasonality, such as food supply or day light. Exper- imental studies on adult krill have demonstrated that spe- ciWc physiological adaptations during autumn and winter, such as reduced metabolic rates and feeding activity, are not caused simply by the scarcity of food, as was previ- ously assumed. These adaptations appear to be inXuenced by the local light regime. The physiological functions that larval krill adopt during winter (reduced metabolism, delayed development, lipid utilisation, and variable growth rates) are, in contrast to the adults, under direct control by the available food supply. During winter, the adults often seem to have little association with sea ice (at least until early spring). The larvae, however, feed within sea ice but mainly on the grazers of the ice algal community rather than on the algae themselves. In this respect, a miss-match in timing of the occurrence of the last phytoplankton blooms in autumn and the start of the sea ice formation, as has been increasingly observed in the west Antarctic Penin- sula (WAP) region, will impact larval krill development during winter in terms of food supply and consequently the krill stock in this region.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Global change will affect patterns of nutrient upwelling in marine environments, potentially becoming even stricter regulators of phytoplankton primary productivity. To better understand phytoplankton nutrient utilization on the subcellular basis, we assessed the transcriptomic responses of the life-cycle stages of the biogeochemically important microalgae Emiliania huxleyi to nitrogen-limitation. Cells grown in batch cultures were harvested at 'early' and 'full' nitrogen-limitation and were compared with non-limited cells. We applied microarray-based transcriptome profilings, covering 10.000 known E. huxleyi gene models, and screened for expression patterns that indicate the subcellular responses. RESULTS: The diploid life-cycle stage scavenges nitrogen from external organic sources and -like diatoms- uses the ornithine-urea cycle to rapidly turn over cellular nitrogen. The haploid stage reacts similarly, although nitrogen scavenging is less pronounced and lipid oxidation is more prominent. Generally, polyamines and proline appear to constitute major organic pools that back up cellular nitrogen. Both stages induce a malate:quinone-oxidoreductase that efficiently feeds electrons into the respiratory chain and drives ATP generation with reduced respiratory carbon throughput. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the ornithine-urea cycle to budget the cellular nitrogen in situations of limitation resembles the responses observed earlier in diatoms. This suggests that underlying biochemical mechanisms are conserved among distant clades of marine phototrophic protists. The ornithine-urea cycle and proline oxidation appear to constitute a sensory-regulatory system that monitors and controls cellular nitrogen budgets under limitation. The similarity between the responses of the life-cycle stages, despite the usage of different genes, also indicates a strong functional consistency in the responses to nitrogen-limitation that appears to be owed to biochemical requirements. The malate:quinone-oxidoreductase is a genomic feature that appears to be absent from diatom genomes, and it is likely to strongly contribute to the uniquely high endurance of E. huxleyi under nutrient limitation},

The northern krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica, is extremely widely distributed from the arctic North Atlantic to the warm Mediterranean. Respiration measurements showed no seasonal differences in rates determined in krill from the thermally stable Clyde Sea (Scotland) and the cooler but variable Danish Kattegat. In the warm Ligurian Sea, where temperatures are stable, krill showed higher rates in April than in September, indicating reactions to the short but intensive productive season. Krill can passively benefit from enhancements of overall metabolism when ascending into upper, warmer water strata during their pronounced diel vertical migration. MichaelisMenten constants (Km) of citrate synthase (CS) were com- pared. In terms of respiration and enzyme regulation, krill from the Ligurian Sea stand apart: temperature and nutrition appear to be of different influence, relatable to genetic differentiation in the species. In contrast, Km of CS in E. superba is temperature independent, highlighting the species stenothermal physiology. A basal level of activity of digestive enzymes ensures immediate utilization of patchy food sources. Specific induction, including that of chitinases, indicating omnivory in both species, underlines krills exceptional capacity to adapt to highly variable trophic environ- ments. Processes of moult, growth, and reproduction are locally and seasonally adjusted.},

	doi = {10.1098/rstb.2006.1947},
	abstract = {A cause and effect understanding of thermal limitation and adaptation at various levels of biological organization is crucial in the elaboration of how the Antarctic climate has shaped the functional properties of extant Antarctic fauna. At the same time, this understanding requires an integrative view of how the various levels of biological organization may be intertwined. At all levels analysed, the functional specialization to permanently low temperatures implies reduced tolerance of high temperatures, as a trade-off. Maintenance of membrane fluidity, enzyme kinetic properties (Km and kcat) and protein structural flexibility in the cold supports metabolic flux and regulation as well as cellular functioning overall. Gene expression patterns and, even more so, loss of genetic information, especially for myoglobin (Mb) and haemoglobin (Hb) in notothenioid fishes, reflect the specialization of Antarctic organisms to a narrow range of low temperatures. The loss of Mb and Hb in icefish, together with enhanced lipid membrane densities (e.g. higher concentrations of mitochondria), becomes explicable by the exploitation of high oxygen solubility at low metabolic rates in the cold, where an enhanced fraction of oxygen supply occurs through diffusive oxygen flux. Conversely, limited oxygen supply to tissues upon warming is an early cause of functional limitation. Low standard metabolic rates may be linked to extreme stenothermy. The evolutionary forces causing low metabolic rates as a uniform character of life in Antarctic ectothermal animals may be linked to the requirement for high energetic efficiency as required to support higher organismic functioning in the cold. This requirement may result from partial compensation for the thermal limitation of growth, while other functions like hatching, development, reproduction and ageing are largely delayed. As a perspective, the integrative approach suggests that the patterns of oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance are linked, on one hand, with the capacity and design of molecules and membranes, and, on the other hand, with life-history consequences and lifestyles typically seen in the permanent cold. Future research needs to address the detailed aspects of these interrelationships.},

Massive blooms of this species have historically been reported only once per ca. 40 years (i.e. in 1920, 1958 and 1995), but have become increasingly frequent recently (i.e. in 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2006). Both accumulated knowledge on the spatiotemporal distributions and physical modeling of the water circulation show that the medusae are released from benthic polyps during April–June in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea, and transported by the Tsushima Current to the Japan Sea. The bloom in 2005 might be the largest ever in history; as many as 3–5×108 medusae passed through the Tsushima Strait daily during the summer and there were more than 100,000 complaints from commercial fishermen. The recent blooms of N. nomurai may have been caused by environmental changes, such as increased water temperature, eutrophication, coastal modification, and over-fishing in Chinese coastal waters. Frequent jellyfish blooms can apparently be a threat to the fisheries sustainability of the East Asian Marginal Seas, one of the world's most productive fisheries grounds.},

These holoplanktonic predators also have sophisticated ciliated locomotion, behaviour and distinct development. Here we present the draft genome of Pleurobrachia bachei, Pacific sea gooseberry, together with ten other ctenophore transcriptomes, and show that they are remarkably distinct from other animal genomes in their content of neurogenic, immune and developmental genes. Our integrative analyses place Ctenophora as the earliest lineage within Metazoa. This hypothesis is supported by comparative analysis of multiple gene families, including the apparent absence of HOX genes, canonical microRNA machinery, and reduced immune complement in ctenophores. Although two distinct nervous systems are well recognized in ctenophores, many bilaterian neuron-specific genes and genes of ‘classical’ neurotransmitter pathways either are absent or, if present, are not expressed in neurons. Our metabolomic and physiological data are consistent with the hypothesis that ctenophore neural systems, and possibly muscle specification, evolved independently from those in other animals.},

Differences between length frequency distributions of samples obtained by both methods were investigated once net-caught specimens had been subject to the simulated effects of geothermally heated waters. Differences between maturity stage/sex ratios for E. superba samples were also assessed. No significant differences between sizes of net-caught or beach-sampled E. crystallorophias were detected, but significant differences were found between both the sizes and sex/maturity stages for E. superba samples.

Results indicate the existence of significant genetic differences between samples, and we suggest that oceanographic barriers could be sufficiently strong and temporally stable to restrict gene flow between distinct areas. Moreover, our data indicate that Antarctic krill is not at mutation–drift equilibrium and that the species possibly has a low effective population size as compared to the census size.},

	abstract = {A method is described for bath-labeling small fish, bivalves and crustacea with thymidine analogs to quantify cell proliferation. Medaka (Oryzias latipes), clams (Mya arenaria) and copepods (Pseudodiaptomus coronatus) were exposed to waterborne bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 30 mg/l) and fluorodeoxyuridine (FdU, 3 mg/l). A simple spectrophotometric method was developed to monitor uridine uptake from the water by animals. BrdU incorporation into nuclei was detected immunohistochemically, allowing estimation of a proliferation index for different organs and cell types. Bath exposure to BrdU will be useful in study of the response of organisms to chemicals such as epigenetic carcinogens that alter rates of cell proliferation especially in organs with a normally low turnover rate, such as the liver. The procedures may also be applied as an assay for growth, in so far as cell division is central to organism growth.},

High concentrations of ammonia/ammonium (NH3/ NH 4z) were measured only in the hemolymph of Calanoides acutus, an Antarctic copepod definitely known to undergo vertical ontogenetic migrations and diapause at great depth, and in Rhincalanus gigas, in which a vertical ontogenetic migration pattern associated with diapause is still under debate. None of the other investigated species showed elevated ammonium concentrations in their hemolymph. We suggest that ion replacement by ammonium contributes to neutral buoyancy in diapausing calanoid copepods in the Southern Ocean. We hypothesize that ammonium buoyancy changes with season and is associated with shifts in extracellular pH and, therefore, most likely mediates metabolic depression during diapause.},

Despite its ecological importance and ongoing climate changes, limited knowledge at the genomic level has hindered the understanding of the molecular processes underlying environmental stress responses and ecological adaptation. Transcriptome data was generated from an experiment with C. glacialis copepodite (CV) subjected to five different temperatures. We obtained a total of 512,352 high-quality 454 pyrosequencing reads, which were assembled into 55,562 contigs distributed in 128 KEGG pathways. Functional analysis revealed numerous genes related to diverse biological functions and processes, including members of all major conserved signaling pathways. Comparative analysis of acclimated individuals to experimental temperatures has provided information about gene variations observed in several pathways (e.g. genes involved in energy, lipid and amino acid metabolism were shown to be down-regulated with increasing temperatures). These mRNA sequence resources will facilitate further studies on genomics and physiology-driven molecular processes in C. glacialis and related species.},

The advantage conferred on organisms that anticipate such environmental cycles has driven the evolution of endogenous circadian rhythms that tune internal physiology to external conditions. The molecular phylogeny of mechanisms driving these rhythms has been difficult to dissect because identified clock genes and proteins are not conserved across the domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota. Here we show that oxidation-reduction cycles of peroxiredoxin proteins constitute a universal marker for circadian rhythms in all domains of life, by characterizing their oscillations in a variety of model organisms. Furthermore, we explore the interconnectivity between these metabolic cycles and transcription-translation feedback loops of the clockwork in each system. Our results suggest an intimate co-evolution of cellular timekeeping with redox homeostatic mechanisms after the Great Oxidation Event 2.5billion years ago},

Light reactions of this species were investigated in the laboratory, where positive phototaxis and light-controlled geotaxis were found. Based on these, a model for depth control in diel migration is proposed. The field studies disclosed that light inhibits feeding and suggested that the state of satiation of the animal influences its depth control mechanism. The usual method of assessing vertical migration from stratified samples is criticized, and an explanation of "midnight sinking," involving rapid turnover of feeding animals in surface waters, is offered. The diet of Sagitta was examined in summer and winter and related to the availability of different copepods. The relationship of diel migration to feeding activity led to a preponderance of surface-living copepods in Sagitta's diet. This effect can distort calculations of food selection. Theories of adaptive value are briefly discussed and it is concluded that Sagitta left the surface waters during the day primarily in order to avoid visually directed predation.},

In situ observations needed for validation of remote sensing data and sea-ice models are limited; most have been restricted to a few point measurements on selected ice floes, or to visual shipboard estimates. Here we present three-dimensional (3D) floe-scale maps of sea-ice draft for ten floes, compiled from two springtime expeditions by an autonomous underwater vehicle to the near-coastal regions of the Weddell, Bellingshausen, and Wilkes Land sectors of Antarctica. Mean drafts range from 1.4 to 5.5 m, with maxima up to 16 m. We also find that, on average, 76\% of the ice volume is deformed ice. Our surveys indicate that the floes are much thicker and more deformed than reported by most drilling and ship-based measurements of Antarctic sea ice. We suggest that thick ice in the near-coastal and interior pack may be under-represented in existing in situ assessments of Antarctic sea ice and hence, on average, Antarctic sea ice may be thicker than previously thought.},

Onset of Antarctic glaciation reflects a critical tipping point for Earth's climate and provides a framework for investigating the role of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO(2)) during major climatic change. Previously published records of alkenone-based CO(2) from high- and low-latitude ocean localities suggested that CO(2) increased during glaciation, in contradiction to theory. Here, we further investigate alkenone records and demonstrate that Antarctic and subantarctic data overestimate atmospheric CO(2) levels, biasing long-term trends. Our results show that CO(2) declined before and during Antarctic glaciation and support a substantial CO(2) decrease as the primary agent forcing Antarctic glaciation, consistent with model-derived CO(2) thresholds},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Based on the relationship between otolith and somatic growth rates, we examined the effect of growth and developmental rates on survival during larval and early juvenile stages in Japanese anchovy Engraulis japonicus collected in the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition region in the western North Pacific. Mean daily otolith increment width (IW) positively correlated with mean growth and developmental rates in rearing experiments. In the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition region, faster-growing larvae with larger IWs attained completion of metamorphosis at younger ages than slower-growing larvae. The minimum IWs in the recruited adults collected in 1999 greatly increased from 4.8 µm at 40 d after hatching to 11.0 µm at 60 d, while the minimum IWs in the pre-recruits collected in 1998 was less than 5.0 µm at 60 d, and accounted for ca. 60\% of the total pre-recruit population. Based on the positive relationship between IWs and growth rates in the rearing experiments, an IW of 11.0 µm is estimated to correspond to 0.41 mm d-1 in growth rate. It was concluded that pre-recruits with growth rates {\textless}0.41 mm d-1 at 60 d have a negligible probability of survival to recruitment. Mortality dependent on growth and developmental rates occurred in the metamorphosing stage of E. japonicus in the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition region. Since environmental conditions in the transition region are variable, and these conditions affect growth and developmental rates of larvae, the rates in the metamorphosing stage could determine the abundance of recruited 1 yr old E. japonicus in the transition region.},

	abstract = {Determining how climate fluctuations affect ocean ecosystems requires an understanding of how biological and physical processes interact across a wide range of scales. Here we examine the role of physical and biological processes in generating fluctuations in the ecosystem around South Georgia in the South Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Anomalies in sea surface temperature (SST) in the South Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean have previously been shown to be generated through atmospheric teleconnections with El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related processes. These SST anomalies are propagated via the Antarctic Circumpolar Current into the South Atlantic (on time scales of more than 1 year), where ENSO and Southern Annular Mode-related atmospheric processes have a direct influence on short (less than six months) time scales. We find that across the South Atlantic sector, these changes in SST, and related fluctuations in winter sea ice extent, affect the recruitment and dispersal of Antarctic krill. This oceanographically driven variation in krill population dynamics and abundance in turn affects the breeding success of seabird and marine mammal predators that depend on krill as food. Such propagating anomalies, mediated through physical and trophic interactions, are likely to be an important component of variation in ocean ecosystems and affect responses to longer term change. Population models derived on the basis of these oceanic fluctuations indicate that plausible rates of regional warming of 1oC over the next 100 years could lead to more than a 95\% reduction in the biomass and abundance of krill across the Scotia Sea by the end of the century.},

They play a key role in the lipid-based energy flux in the Arctic, converting low-energy carbohydrates and proteins in ice algae and phytoplankton into high-energy wax esters. In this paper we review the over-wintering strategy, seasonal migration, stage development, life span, feeding strategy, body size, lipid biochemistry and the geographic distribution of the three dominant Calanus species in Arctic waters. We then relate these parameters to other biotic and abiotic factors, such as the timing of the Arctic phytoplankton and ice algae bloom, sea ice cover and climate variability. We also present new data on fatty acid and fatty alcohol content in the three Calanus species in addition to reviewing the available literature on these topics. These data are analysed for species homogeneity and geographic grouping. The dominance of diatom fatty acid trophic markers in the lipids of Calanus underpins the importance of diatoms as Arctic primary producers, even if dinoflagellates and Phaeocystis pouchetii can also be important food sources for the calanoid copepods. We conclude that the Arctic Calanus species are herbivores, engineered to feed on the Arctic bloom, and that the timing of the bloom is the most important factor in determining the life strategies of the individual species.},

In conjunction with moult and growth data, these may also prove useful for assessing the fishable biomass of krill. Here, the development of physiological concepts in experimental krill research is briefly evaluated, with emphasis on the gaps to be filled. Krill growth is very flexible, as well as strongly temperature and nutrition dependent. The polar Antarctic krill Euphausia superba grows as fast as the boreal species Meganyctiphanes norvegica, at least during the first 2.5 years, and the species are comparable in terms of physiological plasticity. Accordingly, as krill appear to adjust quickly to specific laboratory conditions, short-term experiments are essential if field conditions are to be reflected as closely as possible. Furthermore, direct comparisons between laboratory experiments and swarming studies in the field are advantageous. For these, M. norvegica is particularly well-suited, as swarms can be followed over longer times and more easily than in E. superba. For example, processes of moult and reproduction were found to be highly coordinated in swarms and populations of Northern krill. For this species a conceptual model of reproduction was developed based on a combination of short-term laboratory observations coupled with field data on moult and ovary stages. In further physiological experiments krill should be studied as groups when swarming. Using proxies, that is applying physiological and/or biochemical methods side by side, is a promising way to enhance the reliability of life history data.},

	abstract = {The diel vertical migration (DVM) of Calanus (Calanus finmarchicus, Calanus glacialis and Calanus hyperboreus) and Metridia longa was investigated in August 2008 at six locations to the north and northwest of Svalbard (Rijpfjorden, Ice, Marginal Ice Zone, Shelf break, Shelf and Kongsfjorden). Despite midnight sun conditions, a diel light cycle was clearly observed at all stations. We collected data on zooplankton vertical distribution using a Multi Plankton Sampler (200-μm mesh size) and an EK60 echosounder system (38, 120 and 200 kHz). These were supplemented by environmental data collected using a standard conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD) profiler. The sea ice had recently opened in Rijpfjorden, Ice and Shelf stations, and these stations exhibited phytoplankton bloom conditions with pronounced fluorescence maxima at approximately 30 m. In contrast, Kongsfjorden was more representative of autumn conditions, with the Arctic bloom having culminated 2–3 months prior to sampling. All three Calanus species were found shallower than 50 m on average at Rijpfjorden and the Ice station, while C. glacialis and C. hyperboreus were found deeper than 200 m on average at Kongsfjorden. Shallow water DVM behaviour ({\textless}50 m) was observed at Rijpfjorden and the Shelf station, especially among the C. finmarchicus CI-CIII population, which was particularly abundant at the Shelf ({\textgreater}5,000 individuals/m3). A bimodal depth distribution was observed among C. finmarchicus at the Shelf break station, with CI-CIII copepodites dominating at depths shallower than 100 m and CIV-adult stages dominating at depths exceeding 600 m. Statistical analyses revealed significant differences between the day and night 200-kHz data, particularly at specified depth strata (25–50 m) where backscatter intensity was higher during the day, especially in Rijpfjorden and at the Ice station. We conclude that DVM signals exist in the Arctic during late summer/autumn, when a need to feed and an abundant food source exists, and these signals are primarily due to mesozooplankton.},

	abstract = {Data from a variety of sources reveal a warm-core anticyclonic circulation above the Northwest Georgia Rise (NWGR), an ∼2000-m high bathymetric feature north of South Georgia. The sense of the circulation is opposite to the general cyclonic flow in the Georgia Basin. The circulation shows the characteristics of a stratified Taylor column: dimensional analysis shows that the local bathymetry and hydrography are conducive to the formation of such. ERS2 altimeter data show that the column, whilst not fully permanent, is nonetheless a recurring feature. High concentrations of chlorophyll-a are observed at the centre of the circulation, indicating that the modulation of the physical environment has significant consequences for the local biogeochemical system via enhanced primary production. Enhanced chlorophyll-a extends in a long plume from the NWGR along pathways indicated by drifters; this passive redistribution may have consequences for the larger (basin-) scale ecosystem.},

	abstract = {In the coming decades and centuries, the ocean’s biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems will become increasingly stressed by at least three independent factors. Rising temperatures, ocean acidification and ocean deoxygenation will cause substantial changes in the physical, chemical and biological environment, which will then affect the ocean’s biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems in ways that we are only beginning to fathom. Ocean warming will not only affect organisms and biogeochemical cycles directly, but will also increase upper ocean stratification. The changes in the ocean’s carbonate chemistry induced by the uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) (i.e. ocean acidification) will probably affect many organisms and processes, although in ways that are currently not well understood. Ocean deoxygenation, i.e. the loss of dissolved oxygen (O2) from the ocean, is bound to occur in a warming and more stratified ocean, causing stress to macro-organisms that critically depend on sufficient levels of oxygen. These three stressors—warming, acidification and deoxygenation—will tend to operate globally, although with distinct regional differences. The impacts of ocean acidification tend to be strongest in the high latitudes, whereas the low-oxygen regions of the low latitudes are most vulnerable to ocean deoxygenation. Specific regions, such as the eastern boundary upwelling systems, will be strongly affected by all three stressors, making them potential hotspots for change. Of additional concern are synergistic effects, such as ocean acidification-induced changes in the type and magnitude of the organic matter exported to the ocean’s interior, which then might cause substantial changes in the oxygen concentration there. Ocean warming, acidification and deoxygenation are essentially irreversible on centennial time scales, i.e. once these changes have occurred, it will take centuries for the ocean to recover. With the emission of CO2 being the primary driver behind all three stressors, the primary mitigation strategy is to reduce these emissions.},

	abstract = {Length-frequency data for Euphausia superba and chlorophyll a concentrations from Admiralty Bay, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica over 1 year were used to test the hypothesis that krill growth is limited by food concentration. Growth rates calculated using the ELEFAN computer program yielded values comparable with laboratory rates, but gave slow positive growth rather than negative or zero growth during winter. Seasonal growth rates closely followed water column pigment concentration, and indicated that both krill age class and food concentration should be included in models of krill growth. Growth rate of Group 0, I and II age classes was a hyperbolic function of food concentration. Maximum growth rates varied with age class and occurred only at concentrations greater than about 50 μg Chl a m−2. Age class specific thresholds for zero growth occurred at water column concentrations of 9.2–17.5 μg Chl a m−2 or 0.06–0.1 μg Chl a l−1 with homogeneous pigment concentration. Negative growth is expected at concentrations below these thresholds. The analysis demonstrates that krill growth was food limited for six months of the year, but also shows that krill can often meet their minimum requirements for growth at the low concentrations of phytoplankton characterizing offshore Southern Ocean waters.},

Tissues represented in the Carcinus library were anterior and posterior gills, hypodermis, heart, hepatopancreas, antennal gland, brain, testis, and skeletal muscle, obtained from animals acclimated to 35 and 10 salinity. Tissues represented in the Homarus library were gill, epipodite, branchiostegite, heart, ovary, testis, antennal gland, skeletal muscle, hepatopancreas, and brain, obtained from intermolt and post-molt animals. Directional libraries from oligo-dT-primed cDNA were constructed in the pCMVsport6.1 vector and normalized by self-subtraction at 2 different Cot values. Randomly picked clones were single-pass sequenced from the 5' end. Raw sequence data were trimmed and prepared for submission to dbEST using phred, cross-match, and blastx protocols embedded within trace2dbest software. A total of 4604 Homarus and 12 401 Carcinus ESTs produced 540 and 2651 clusters, respectively, as determined by TIGR Gene Index Clustering software. Gene Ontology analysis with reference to a Drosophila melanogaster database using GOblet revealed 187 positive hits (35\%) with the Homarus clusters and 1037 positive hits (39\%) with the Carcinus clusters. Combining the number of assembled sequences with the number of singlets obtained after cluster analysis suggested that transcripts representing as much as 25\% of the total number of genes in Carcinus have been isolated},

	abstract = {Effects of feeding and starvation on the moult cycle and on the ultrastructure of hepatopancreas cells were studied in Stage I lobster larvae (Homarus americanus Milne-Edwards). The relative significance of yolk and first food was quite different in larvae originating from two females. This difference was evident also in the amounts of stored lipid in the R-cells of the larval hepatopancreas. Most larvae from one hatch were, in principle, able to develop exclusively with yolk reserves (without food) to the second instar. The larvae from the second hatch showed lecithotrophic development only to the transition between late intermoult and early premoult (Stages C/D0 of Drachs's moult cycle) of the first larval instar. When initial starvation in this group lasted for 3 days or more, the point of no return (PNR) was exceeded. After the PNR, consumption of food was still possible, but development ceased in the transition C/D0 or in late premoult (D3–4). It is suggested that these stages of the moult cycle are critical points were cessation of development and increased mortality are particularly likely in early larval lobsters under nutritional stress. Examination of hepatopancreas R-cells suggested that the PNR is caused by an irreversible loss of the ability to restore lipid reserves depleted during initial starvation. Initial periods of starvation ending before the PNR prolonged mainly Stage D0 of the same instar (I). During this delay, structural changes in the R-cells caused by the preceding period of starvation were reversed: reduced lipid inclusions, swollen mitochondria, an increased number of residual bodies indicating autolysis, and a reduction of the microvillous processes. Continually starved larvae which showed lecithotrophic development throughout the first instar and were then re-fed after moulting successfully, had later a prolonged intermoult (Stage C) period in the second instar. This shows that, despite occasional lecithotrophy, food is an important factor in early larval development of the lobster.},

	abstract = {Larvae of Euphausia superba Dana were reared from embryo to Calyptopis 3 in the laboratory at four temperatures characteristic of the range found in the environment (−1, 0, 1, and 2°C). The relationship between temperature and developmental times was curvilinear, with a sharp decrease in developmental time between −1 and 0°C, followed by a gradual flattening of the curve. The relationship was best described by the exponential model D = B0∗ e−B1(T) + B2, where D is developmental time in days, T is the temperature, and B0, B1, and B2 are fitted constants. In three of the four batches of larvae reared at −1°C, all larvae died within 3 days of metamorphosis to Calyptopis 1, while siblings at higher temperatures developed normally. These results suggests that a cold sensitive period exists during early larval development. The type of food available also affected the survival of three groups of siblings. Larvae fed a diatom mixture developed normally, while those fed a small flagellate or starved all died before metamorphosis to Calyptopis 2. The effects of temperature and food type on the development and survival of the early larval stages have important ecological implications for the recruitment of E. superba. If spawning occurs in areas where the embryos or larvae encounter subzero water during a temperature sensitive period, recruitment in these waters may be very low, independent of food availability. If the embryos and larvae do not encounter subzero water during a sensitive period, recruitment may be more dependent on the type and concentration of food available.},

	abstract = {While a seasonal ice cover limits light penetration into both polar seas for up to ten months a year, its presence is not entirely negative. The mixed layer under sea ice will generally be shallower than in open water at the same latitude and season. Ice forms a substrate on which primary production can be concentrated, a condition which contrasts with the generally dilute nutritional conditions which prevail in the remaining ocean. The combination of a shallow, generally stable mixed layer with a close proximity to abundant food make the under-ice zone a suitable nursery for both pelagic and benthic species, an upside-down benthos for opportunistic substrate browsers, and a rich feeding environment for species often considered to be neritic in temperate environments. Where the ice cover is not continuous there may be a retreating ice edge that facilitates the seasonal production of phytoplankton primarily through increased stability from the melt water. Ice edge blooms similarly encourage secondary production by pelagic animals. Pseudocalanus acuspes, which may be the most abundant and productive copepod in north polar latitudes, initiates growth at the start of the “spring bloom” of epontic algae, reaching sexual maturity at breakup or slightly before. In the Southern Hemisphere, the small neritic copepod Paralabidocera antarctica and adult krill have been observed to utilize ice algae. Calanus hyperboreus breeds in the dark season at depth and its buoyant eggs, slowly developing on the ascent, reach the under-ice layer in April as nauplii ready to benefit from the primary production there. On the other hand, C. glacialis may initiate ontogenetic migrations and reproduction in response to increased erosion of ice algae due to solar warming and melting at the ice-water interface. While the same species in a phytoplankton bloom near the ice edge reproduces actively, those under still-consolidated ice nearby can have immature gonads. Diel migration and diel feeding rhythms under or near the ice have also been observed for several species. In the Northern Hemisphere larger zooplanktonic species may take two, three, or possibly more years to reach maturity, but the grand strategy, apparently used by all, is to assure that their young have reached active feeding stages by the time of maximum primary production in the water column so that maximum growth, often, but not always, with emphasis on lipid storage, can occur during the often brief, but usually intense, summer bloom. The rate of growth of arctic or antarctic zooplankton is not so important as assuring a high level of fecundity when maturity comes. Overwintering is probably not a great hardship and diapause may not be a useful strategy because the environmental temperature is constantly near the freezing point of sea water, and basal metabolism accordingly low. Nonetheless, feeding behaviour and metabolic rates have strong seasonal signals. In the absence of other stimuli, light must be involved in the transformation from winter to summer metabolism and visa versa but the mechanisms still remain obscure.},

Biomass was estimated by using biovolume calculations and literature conversion factors. Sampling was carried out at three depths, surface, 50 and 100 m. The dominant taxa were made up of tintinnid ciliates, ciliates other than tintinnids, larvae of micrometazoa and heterotrophic dinoflagellates. The abundance of the total microplankton fraction had its absolute maximum in the center of Terra Nova Bay at the surface with 31 042 ind. dm−3. The areal and vertical distribution of heterotrophic microplankton biomass differs from that of abundance. On the basis of hydrological conditions, phytoplankton composition and biomass and microzooplankton biomass and structure it is possible to identify three groups of stations: 1—northern coastal stations (intermediate chlorophyll maxima, microphytoplankton prevalence, low microzooplankton biomass); 2—central stations (high surface chlorophyll, nanoplankton prevalence, high abundance of microzooplankton); 3—northern stations (deeper pycnocline, nanoplankton prevalence, high microzooplankton biomass at intermediate depths).},

Amounts of krill washed onto the ice during ice-breaking along transects were noted. Juvenile and sub-adult krill were found, often in high numbers, in association with seasonal pack-ice, from the outer marginal ice zone to at least 200 nautical miles [3 50 km] into the closed pack-ice zone. Krill caught with the RMT or observed within or close to the ice usually had full guts. They were frequently seen feeding on ice algae, and seemed to concentrate in pressure zones, melting ice and infiltration layers, ie where ice provided both confining crevices and rich algal growth. During twilight numbers of krill increased in open water close to the ice, though ROV observations at night revealed even greater numbers remaining in ice cavities. Direct observations from deck, by divers and by ROV, confirmed that most of the krill population in the uppermost water layer was confined to ice habitats, though in three out of 20 RMT catches krill reached densities of 0.1 nr3 ie normal summer values. ‘Miniswarms’ forming in early November may indicate seasonal transition of at least part of the krill population from winter ice habitat and grazing on ice-algae, to summer pelagic life and filter-feeding on phytoplankton.},

	volume = {29},
	abstract = {Metabolic pathways of proline consumption in working ight muscles and its resynthesis were investigated in the African fruit beetle, Pachnoda sinuata. Mitochondria isolated from ight muscles oxidise proline, pyruvate and α-glycerophosphate, but not palmitoyl-carnitine. At low proline concentrations, the respiration rate during co-oxidation of proline and pyruvate is additive, while at high proline concen-trations it is equal to the respiration rates of proline oxidation. Flight muscles have high activities of alanine aminotransferase and NAD+-dependent malic enzyme which are involved in proline metabolism. Glycogen phosphorylase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (carbohydrate breakdown) also display high activities, whilst 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (fatty acid oxidation) showed low activity. During the oxidation of proline, mitochondria isolated from ight muscles produce equimolar amounts of alanine. The rates of oxygen consumption by the mitochondria during this process lead to the conclusion that proline is partially oxidised. This is con®rmed by the incorporation of radiolabel from pre-injected [U-14C] proline into alanine during a ight experiment with P. sinuata. Proline is resynthesised, in vitro, from alanine and acetyl-CoA in the fat body. High activities of enzymes catalysing such pathways (alanine aminotransferase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and NADP+-dependent malic enzyme) were found. The in vitro production of proline from alanine is equimolar suggesting that resynthesis of one proline molecule is accomplished from one alanine molecule and one acetyl-CoA molecule. One source of the acetyl-CoA for the in vitro synthesis of proline is the lipid stores of the fat body. Proline synthesis by fat body tissue is controlled by feedback. Alanine aminotransferase is competitively inhibited by high proline concentrations.},

Subsequently, the three tissues differed in that (a) in the midgut gland the level of ribosomal RNA and protein synthesis returned to the intermolt rates before ecdysis whether or not the mass of the tissue was increasing or decreasing; (b) ribosomal RNA and protein synthesis in epithelium reached a maximum at a time when epithelial cells reached a maximal size; subsequently, all three parameters decreased toward intermolt levels before ecdysis; (c) ribosomal RNA and protein synthesis reached a maximum in the premolt period in somatic muscle while the muscle was in fact decreasing in mass. Muscle ribosomes are very stable and appear to be conserved for weeks or months to be reused after ecdysis in a second burst of protein synthetic activity at the time when there is replacement and growth of new muscular tissue. The relation of these events with hormonal control of growth is discussed.},

	volume = {362},
	abstract = {Surveys of Euphausia superbaoften target lo-calised shelves and ice edges where their growth rates and predation losses are atypically high. Emphasis on these ar-eas has led to the current view that krill require high food concentrations, with a distribution often linked to shelves. For a wider, circumpolar perspective, we compiled all available net-based density data on postlarvae from 8137 mainly summer stations from 1926 to 2004. Unlike Antarc-tic zooplankton, the distribution of E. superbais highly un-even, with 70\% of the total stock concentrated between longitudes 0$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$and 90$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$W. Within this Atlantic sector, krill are abundant over both continental shelf and ocean. At the Antarctic Peninsula they are found mainly over the inner shelf, whereas in the Indian-Pacific sectors krill prevail in the ocean within 200 to 300 km of the shelf break. Overall, 87\% of the total stock lives over deep oceanic water ({\textgreater}2000 m), and krill occupy regions with moderate food concentrations (0.5 to 1.0 mg chl am-3). Advection models suggest some northwards loss from these regions and into the low chlorophyll belts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Cur-rent (ACC). We found possible evidence for a compensat-ing southwards migration, with an increasing proportion of krill found south of the ACC as the season progresses. The retention of krill in moderately productive oceanic habitats is a key factor in their high total production. While growth rates are lower than over shelves, the ocean provides a refuge from shelf-based predators. The unusual circumpo-lar distribution of krill thus reflects a balance between ad-vection, migration, top-down and bottom-up processes.},

	abstract = {The Cryptochrome/Photolyase Family (CPF) represents an ancient group of widely distributed UV-A/blue-light sensitive proteins sharing common structures and chromophores. During the course of evolution, different CPFs acquired distinct functions in DNA repair, light perception and circadian clock regulation. Previous phylogenetic analyses of the CPF have allowed reconstruction of the evolution and distribution of the different CPF super-classes in the tree of life. However, so far only limited information is available from the CPF orthologs in aquatic organisms that evolved in environments harboring great diversity of life forms and showing peculiar light distribution and rhythms. To gain new insights into the evolutionary and functional relationships within the CPF family, we performed a detailed study of CPF members from marine (diatoms, sea urchin and annelid) and freshwater organisms (teleost) that populate diverse habitats and exhibit different life strategies. In particular, we first extended the CPF family phylogeny by including genes from aquatic organisms representative of several branches of the tree of life. Our analysis identifies four major super-classes of CPF proteins and importantly singles out the presence of a plant-like CRY in diatoms and in metazoans. Moreover, we show a dynamic evolution of Cpf genes in eukaryotes with various events of gene duplication coupled to functional diversification and gene loss, which have shaped the complex array of Cpf genes in extant aquatic organisms. Second, we uncover clear rhythmic diurnal expression patterns and light-dependent regulation for the majority of the analyzed Cpf genes in our reference species.

Our analyses reconstruct the molecular evolution of the CPF family in eukaryotes and provide a solid foundation for a systematic characterization of novel light activated proteins in aquatic environments.},

	abstract = {The physiological condition of larval Antarctic krill was investigated during austral autumn 2004 and winter 2006 in the Lazarev Sea. The condition of larvae was quantified in both seasons by determining their body length (BL), dry weight (DW), elemental and biochemical composition, stomach content analysis, and rates of metabolism and growth. Overall the larvae in autumn were in better condition under the ice than in open water, and for those under the ice, condition decreased from autumn to winter. Thus, growth rates of furcilia larvae in open water in autumn were similar to winter values under the ice (mean, 0.008mmd21), whereas autumn under- ice values were higher (0.015 mm d21). Equivalent larval stages in winter had up to 30\% shorter BL and 70\% lower DW than in autumn. Mean respiration rates of winter larvae were 43\% lower than of autumn larvae. However, their ammonium excretion rates doubled in winter from 0.03 to 0.06 mgNH4 DW21 h21, resulting in mean O:N ratios of 46 in autumn and 15 in winter. Thus, differing metabolic substrates were used between autumn and winter, which supports a degree of flexibility for overwintering of larval krill. The larvae were eating small copepods (Oithona spp.) and protozoans, as well as autotrophic food under the ice. The interplay between under-ice topography, apparent current speed under sea ice, and the swimming ability of larval krill is probably critical to whether larval krill can maintain position and exploit suitable feeding areas under the ice.},

Two periods of reproduction were observed: spring and late summer/autumn. The older copepodids, having accumulated lipid reserves during phytoplankton bloom, descended into the meta- and hypolimnion at the beginning of the summer. These copepods did not feed, but instead consumed their lipid reserves. A considerable delay in development (up to 40-60 days) of CIVs and CVs was found. The descended CIVs and CVs incubated under ambient temperature developed 4-5 times slower than their surface counterparts, while temperature dependence could only account for a 2-fold slow down. The descended copepods are believed to form a summer resting stock. In October, females began to produce resting eggs. The period of switching from subitaneous to resting egg production was very brief, not longer than 2-3 weeks. The percentage of subitaneous eggs produced in mid-October tended to increase when females were exposed to an increased photoperiod. At the beginning of February, latent eggs kept in a cooling container in the darkness started hatching. This process could be speeded up under natural photoperiod and increased temperature. The over-wintering population consisted largely of adults. Thus,{\textless}it{\textgreater}E.graciloides{\textless}/it{\textgreater} includes three types of diapause in the life cycle: resting eggs, summer resting stage at CIV-CV, and overwintering adults.},

The resulting active downward transport of carbon by the 200–1000 and {\textgreater}1000 μm mesozooplankton fractions was quantified based on 41 biomass and respiration profiles from October 2007 to July 2008 in the Amundsen Gulf (Canadian Arctic Ocean). The small fraction, dominated by CII-CIII Calanus glacialis, represented on average 12\% of the overall zooplankton biomass and contributed little to the active transport of carbon by respiration. From April to July, total zooplankton ingested 17–28\% of the estimated gross primary production (GPP) in the surface 100 m, and 36–59\% of GPP over the entire water column. The large fraction, comprised mainly of CIV, CV and adults Calanus hyperboreus and C. glacialis that accumulate large lipid reserves, was responsible for 89\% of grazing. The downward migration of large zooplankton in late summer coincided with a sharp decline in specific respiration rates signaling the start of diapause and the endogenous fuelling of metabolism. From October to April, Calanus migration-respiration actively transported 3.1 g C m−2 beyond 100 m, a flux that represented 85 to 132\% of the gravitational POC fluxes at 100 m from October to July. Our results stress the importance of including active transport by large zooplankton migrants in carbon budgets of the Arctic Ocean.},

	abstract = {We report data from the first 8 years of oceanographic monitoring in Ryder Bay, northern Marguerite Bay, Antarctica. These data form the oceanographic component of the Rothera Oceanographic and Biological Time-Series (RaTS) project. When weather and ice permit, the RaTS station is occupied every 5 days in summer and weekly in winter. Observations comprise a conductivity–temperature–depth (CTD) cast to 500 m and a water sample from 15 m, this being the depth of the chlorophyll maximum in most years. The water samples provide data on total chlorophyll (size-fractionated at 20, 5, 2 and 0.2 μm), macronutrients (N, P and Si) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The CTD profiles reveal strong seasonality in the topmost Antarctic Surface Water (AASW) driven by summer solar heating and winter cooling with brine rejection during ice formation. The depth of the winter mixed layer reaches a maximum in August, with annual maximum values ranging from ∼30 to \&gt;140 m. Below the AASW is the relatively aseasonal Winter Water (WW), and the bottom of the profile indicates the presence of modified Upper Circumpolar Deep Water (UCDW). Summer chlorophyll typically exceeds 20 mg m−3, with the peak in January. Vertical flux of phytodetritus is also predominantly in January. The summer bloom is dominated by large diatoms and colonial forms, whereas in winter most of the chlorophyll is in the nanophytoplankton (20–5 μm) fraction. Macronutrients show marked seasonality with N:P covariation close to Redfield (∼15.3) and Si:N stoichiometry ∼1.67. Summer DOC values show little seasonality and relatively high winter levels (\&gt;50 μM). Surface waters also exhibit a marked interannual variability, with ENSO as an important driver at subdecadal scales.},

But, in 1986, marine chronobiologists began to accumulate laboratory results that could not be explained by the action of such a clock. Prime among these findings was the discovery that, occasionally, one of the two daily peaks in an organism's rhythm assumed a different period from its partner. Similar results have since been observed in a host of different organisms. These data led to the circalunidian-clock hypothesis that envisions two basic 24.8 h clocks, coupled together in antiphase, as the driving force for these rhythms. There is, however, only a slight difference (50 minutes) in running times between a solar-day clock with a period of approximately 24 h and a lunar-day clock with a period of approximately 24.8 h, both of which display "circa" periods that overlap. Here, I postulate that the two clocks are fundamentally one and the same. BioEssays 22:32-37, 2000.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Diel vertical distribution patterns of dominant zooplankton taxa were studied during a period of midnight sun (May 1999) in the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) of the Barents Sea along 2 transects across the ice edge. Eight stations were sampled every 6 h over 24 h at 5 depth intervals. Our study confirmed that copepod nauplii (most probably Calanus hyperboreus and C. glacialis) together with Pseudocalanus spp. preferred the surface water layer. The herbivores C. finmarchicus, C. glacialis, and C. hyperboreus concentrated in the upper 50 m depth interval, whereas the omnivores Metridia longa and Microcalanus spp. were generally found in deeper waters. As a result of vertical distribution patterns of the numerically abundant taxa, a bulk of zooplankton was concentrated within the 0–50 m layer. Vertical distribution patterns of all examined taxa/groups varied in time as a result of habitat changes (with respect to water mass distribution and sea depth) as well as random patchiness. Based on our data and on a comprehensive literature survey on Arctic zooplankton diel vertical migration (DVM), we postulate that common zooplankton taxa in the MIZ of the Barents Sea do not perform DVM under the midnight sun. Arctic C. glacialis in May 1999 occupied deeper layers at stations with more ice cover and less melt water. This distribution pattern was probably related to the species’ reproduction. At the same time, Atlantic C. finmarchicus was concentrated further away from the ice edge and chlorophyll a maximum, and presumably had not begun its seasonal reproduction.},

In 1981, larval abundance was highest in the open ocean of the central Scotia Sea and in the shelf region close to Elephant Island. Abundance was significantly lower in 1978 when only a few ‘rich’ catches were made northeast of the South Orkney Islands and in the Bransfield Strait. In 1976, Krill larvae occurred in fair numbers in both the Bransfield Strait and the northern Scotia Sea. The Bransfield Strait region appears to be a major spawning area for Krill. Spawning in the open ocean apparently varies from year to year, in both space and time, for which explanations are not yet available. The same holds for large fluctuations in the abundance of larval Krill.},

In contrast, the electroretinogram (ERG) circadian rhythm can be synchronized by either single or periodic melatonin application. In this work we hypothesized that, in crayfish, melatonin acts on effectors and on pacemaker of ERG circadian rhythm as a non-photic synchronizer.

At high latitudes, patterns of DVM have been documented, but rather little knowledge exists regarding which species perform this ecologically important behaviour. Also, in the Arctic, the vertically migrating components of the zooplankton community are usually regarded as a single sound scattering layer (SSL) performing synchronized patterns of migration directly controlled by ambient light. Here, we present evidence for hitherto unknown complexity of Arctic marine systems, where zooplankton form multiple aggregations through the water column seen via acoustics as distinct SSLs. We show that while the initiation of DVM during the autumnal equinox is light mediated, the vertical positioning of the migrants during day is linked more to the thermal characteristics of water masses than to irradiance. During night, phytoplankton biomass is shown to be the most important factor determining the vertical positioning of all migrating taxa. Further, we develop a novel way of representing acoustic data in the form of a Sound Image (SI) that enables a direct comparison of the relative importance of each potential scatterer based upon the theoretical contribution of their backscatter. Based on our comparison of locations with contrasting hydrography, we conclude that a continued warming of the Arctic is likely to result in more complex ecotones across the Arctic marine system.},

	abstract = {In various phyla of marine invertebrates limited capacities of both ventilatory and circulatory performance were found to set the borders of the thermal tolerance window with limitations in aerobic scope and onset of hypoxia as a first line of sensitivity to both cold and warm temperature extremes. The hypothesis of oxygen limited thermal tolerance has recently been investigated in fish using a combination of non-invasive nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methodology with invasive techniques. In contrast to observations in marine invertebrates arterial oxygen tensions in fish were independent of temperature, while venous oxygen tensions displayed a thermal optimum. As the fish heart relies on venous oxygen supply, limited cardio-circulatory capacity is concluded to set the first level of thermal intolerance in fish. Nonetheless, maximized ventilatory capacity is seen to support circulation in maintaining the width of thermal tolerance windows. The interdependent setting of low and high tolerance limits is interpreted to result from trade-offs between optimized tissue functional capacity and baseline oxygen demand and energy turnover co-determined by the adjustment of mitochondrial densities and functional properties to a species-specific temperature range. At temperature extremes, systemic hypoxia will elicit metabolic depression, thereby widening the thermal window transiently sustained especially in those species preadapted to hypoxic environments},

Adult size (cephalothorax and total body length) was inversely proportional to surface water temperature at the time of collection. The major switch from subitaneous to resting egg production occurred during late August to early September, but a small percent of subitaneous eggs continued to be produced throughout the fall. Resting eggs were cold-resistant and when chilled at 5° C hatched synchronously when warmed to 21° to 23° C. Individual resting eggs kept continuously at 19° C took longer to hatch and emergence was asynchronous. The resting eggs of L. aestiva appear to be in a state of diapause similar to many insects, and it is suggested that photoperiod is the primary cue inducing the production of resting eggs.},

Sampling with a Rectangular Midwater Trawl (RMT) and during SCUBA diving were undertaken in the pack-ice during the EPOS expedition 1988/1989 of RV Polarstern. These data were compared with former cruises during late winter (October) and summer (February). The biomass values of krill (1–27 g/m2) in the water column within the ice covered areas were of the same order of magnitude as earlier acoustic estimates in the ice-edge region of the same area. No significant correlation between percentage ice cover and krill abundance in the water column was found. Cluster analyses of size frequency distributions and maturity stage composition revealed the demography of the animals sampled. Samples obtained by SCUBA and RMT are compatible and results show a geographic and demographic separation of the krill. It is proposed that krill in the northern zone are largely emigrants from the Bellingshausen Sea, while the krill in the southern zone are of eastern Weddell Sea origin. Further studies concentrating on the under-ice distribution of krill are recommended.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: The first winter in the life cycle of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is a critical period in which larval survival and recruitment to the adult population are highly sensitive to environmental conditions, yet little is known about larval physiological dynamics during this period. An individual-based model was developed to investigate patterns of larval krill growth and condition factor in response to environmental variability during fall and winter, west of the Antarctic Peninsula. Field and experimental observations from Southern Ocean Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics cruises in 2001 and 2002 and the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research program were used to parameterize the model. Growth was modeled by partitioning total body carbon between length and condition factor. Total body carbon was simulated with empirical temperature-dependent rates of ingestion of phytoplankton and respiration, and ingestion of algae grown on a surface to simulate sea ice algae. Light-driven diel vertical migration modulated ingestion of phytoplankton and sea ice algae as a function of latitude, season and sea ice cover. Simulations highlighted 3 environmental processes that controlled food availability, and consequently, physiological condition of krill: the fall phytoplankton decline, sea ice advance and development of sea ice microbial communities, and the late winter increase in sea ice microbial community biomass. Fall phytoplankton dynamics were identified as a major driver of the physiological condition of larval krill throughout this critical period. The model presents a mechanism that links larval krill survival and recruitment to fall and winter variability in phytoplankton and sea ice dynamics along the western Antarctic Peninsula.},

A 616 base pair region of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene was screened for mutations by single-strand conformational poly-morphism (SSCP) combined with restriction digestion. E. crystallorophias caught in three different regions of the Ant-arctic coastline were used - two samples from the Mertz Glacier Polynya and one sample each from the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula and from the Davis Sea. Signifi-cant genetic differences between krill samples were identified. However, the extent of these differences did not corre-late with the degree of geographic separation between the sampling sites. This suggests that the genetic structuring may be the result of small-scale differentiation rather than differentiation between resident populations in separate parts of the Southern Ocean. The possibility that genetic dif-ferences between samples within a region are as important as differences between regions has implications for other studies of krill population genetics.},

	abstract = {This paper describes growth and maturation of individual Antarctic krill for a complete annual cycle in an artificially controlled environment. Antarctic krill were kept individually and maintained under temperature regimes of ?1, 1 and 3 1C, while light conditions simulated natural seasonal conditions for the 14 months of the experiment starting in April. The growth increment (GI), instantaneous growth rate (IGR), daily growth rate (DGR), intermoult period (IMP) and maturity scores (MS) were tracked by measuring the consecutively moulted exoskeletons and modelled using linear mixed models (LMMs). There was a clear seasonal trend in growth and maturity in the three different temperature treatments. Males generally reached peak growth rates and matured earlier than females, but females showed higher growth rates overall. Negative growth occurred towards the end of January for both males and females, coinciding with the regression of external sexual characteristics. There was, as expected, a significant decline in IMP with increasing temperature, which was moderated by increasing trends with total length (TL) and month for the ?1 1C treatment. For the 1 and 3 1C treatments there was no relationship with TL and the season effect declined after October and December, respectively. For krill with a TL of 40 mm in October, the predicted mean IMP values at ?1, 1 and 3 1C were 28 days, 24 days and 19 days, respectively. There was some evidence to suggest that 1 1C was optimum for growth, as the IMP was significantly lower than at ?1 1C but the difference in GI between the two temperatures was not significantly different from zero, while all growth variables were significantly lower for the 3 compared to the ?1 1C treatment. For the first time, this study has been able to confirm, by fitting a bivariate LMM, that compensation mechanisms do exist between IMP and IGR and to quantify the degree of compensation at both the between- and within-animal levels. This will allow modelling of growth trajectories in the wild to quantify the distribution of length given age.},

The best option is to compare the mRNA level of a target gene with that of reference gene(s) whose expression level is stable across various experimental conditions. In this study, expression profiles of eight candidate reference genes from the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, were evaluated under diverse experimental conditions. RefFinder, a web-based analysis tool, integrates four major computational programs including geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper, and the comparative ΔCt method to comprehensively rank the tested candidate genes. Elongation factor 1 (EF1) was the most suited reference gene for the biotic factors (development stage, tissue, and strain). In contrast, although appropriate reference gene(s) do exist for several abiotic factors (temperature, photoperiod, insecticide, and mechanical injury), we were not able to identify a single universal reference gene. Nevertheless, a suite of candidate reference genes were specifically recommended for selected experimental conditions. Our finding is the first step toward establishing a standardized qRT-PCR analysis of this agriculturally important insect pest},

	abstract = {The availability of dissolved nutrients such as nitrate under extreme low temperatures is a strong determinant in the development and growth of ice diatoms. Consequently we investigated regulation of photosynthesis in a mixed culture of three diatom species, which grew in chemostats at −1 °C, 15 μmol photons m−2 s−1 under N-limitation. When nitrogen is limiting, pigment–protein complexes are one of the most affected structures under low-light conditions. The loss of integral polar thylakoid components destabilized the bilayer structure of the membrane with consequences for lipid composition and the degree of fatty acid desaturation. N-Limitation caused a decrease in monogalactosydiacylglycerol (MGDG) and a simultaneous increase in bilayer forming digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG). Their ratio MGDG:DGDG decreased from 3.4±0.1 to 1.1±0.4, while 20:5 n-3 fatty acids of chloroplast related phospholipid classes such as phosphatidylglycerol (PG) increased under N-limitation. These data reveal that lipids are important components, required to sustain membrane structure under a deficiency of integral membrane bound proteins and pigments. Nonetheless, energy conversion at photosystem II is still affected by N-limitation despite this structural regulation. Photosynthetic quantum yield (Fv/Fm) and electron transport rates decreased under N-limitation caused by an increasing amount of electron acceptors (second stable electron acceptor=QB) which had slower reoxidation kinetics. The energy surplus under these conditions is stored in triacylglycerols, the main energy sink in Antarctic sea ice diatoms under N-limitation.},

	volume = {362},
	issn = {0962-8436},
	abstract = {The Scotia Sea ecosystem is a major component of the circumpolar Southern Ocean system, where productivity and predator demand for prey are high. The eastward-flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and waters from the Weddell-Scotia Confluence dominate the physics of the Scotia Sea, leading to a strong advective flow, intense eddy activity and mixing. There is also strong seasonality, manifest by the changing irradiance and sea ice cover, which leads to shorter summers in the south. Summer phytoplankton blooms, which at times can cover an area of more than 0.5 million km2, probably result from the mixing of micronutrients into surface waters through the flow of the ACC over the Scotia Arc. This production is consumed by a range of species including Antarctic krill, which are the major prey item of large seabird and marine mammal populations. The flow of the ACC is steered north by the Scotia Arc, pushing polar water to lower latitudes, carrying with it krill during spring and summer, which subsidize food webs around South Georgia and the northern Scotia Arc. There is also marked interannual variability in winter sea ice distribution and sea surface temperatures that is linked to southern hemisphere-scale climate processes such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. This variation affects regional primary and secondary production and influences biogeochemical cycles. It also affects krill population dynamics and dispersal, which in turn impacts higher trophic level predator foraging, breeding performance and population dynamics. The ecosystem has also been highly perturbed as a result of harvesting over the last two centuries and significant ecological changes have also occurred in response to rapid regional warming during the second half of the twentieth century. This combination of historical perturbation and rapid regional change highlights that the Scotia Sea ecosystem is likely to show significant change over the next two to three decades, which may result in major ecological shifts},

Crustaceans are a large and diverse group including some economically important species. The efforts to culture them for human consumption has prompted the interest to understand the preferences of energy sources to be applied for feed formulation and cost reduction. Important differences have been found among species and appear to be related not only to the biochemistry and physiology of nutrition, but also to the living environment of the crustaceans. Furthermore, crustaceans undergo morphological, physiological and behavioral changes due to their natural growing process that affect their feeding habits, an aspect that should be carefully considered.

	abstract = {Ocean acidification from the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 is expected to have deleterious consequences for many calcifying marine animals. Forecasting the vulnerability of these marine organisms to climate change is linked to an understanding of whether species possess the physiological capacity to compensate for the potentially adverse effects of ocean acidification. We carried out a microarray-based transcriptomic analysis of the physiological response of larvae of a calcifying marine invertebrate, the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, to CO2-driven seawater acidification. In lab-based cultures, larvae were raised under conditions approximating current ocean pH conditions (pH 8.01) and at projected, more acidic pH conditions (pH 7.96 and 7.88) in seawater aerated with CO2 gas. Targeting expression of ∼1000 genes involved in several biological processes, this study captured changes in gene expression patterns that characterize the transcriptomic response to CO2-driven seawater acidification of developing sea urchin larvae. In response to both elevated CO2 scenarios, larvae underwent broad scale decreases in gene expression in four major cellular processes: biomineralization, cellular stress response, metabolism and apoptosis. This study underscores that physiological processes beyond calcification are impacted greatly, suggesting that overall physiological capacity and not just a singular focus on biomineralization processes is essential for forecasting the impact of future CO2 conditions on marine organisms. Conducted on targeted and vulnerable species, genomics-based studies, such as the one highlighted here, have the potential to identify potential `weak links' in physiological function that may ultimately determine an organism's capacity to tolerate future ocean conditions.},

	abstract = {Sea ice and oceanic boundaries have a dominant effect in structuring Antarctic marine ecosystems. Satellite imagery and historical data have identified the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current as a site of enhanced biological productivity. Meso-scale surveys off the Antarctic peninsula have related the abundances of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and salps (Salpa thompsoni) to inter-annual variations in sea-ice extent. Here we have examined the ecosystem structure and oceanography spanning 3,500 km of the east Antarctic coastline, linking the scales of local surveys and global observations. Between 80 degrees and 150 degrees E there is a threefold variation in the extent of annual sea-ice cover, enabling us to examine the regional effects of sea ice and ocean circulation on biological productivity. Phytoplankton, primary productivity, Antarctic krill, whales and seabirds were concentrated where winter sea-ice extent is maximal, whereas salps were located where the sea-ice extent is minimal. We found enhanced biological activity south of the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current rather than in association with it. We propose that along this coastline ocean circulation determines both the sea-ice conditions and the level of biological productivity at all trophic levels.},

Two groups were fed with the chitinous diatom Cyclotella cryptica and the non-chitinous green algae Dunaliella bioculata, respectively. A control group remained unfed. The time courses of the activities of endo- and exochitinase in the stomach and the midgut gland were compared with those of the digestive enzymes protease, cellulase (1,4-β-d-glucanase) and laminarinase (1,3-β-d-glucanase). Specific activities of all enzymes were higher in the stomach than in the midgut gland. Characteristic time courses of activity were evident after 4 days. In starved animals, enzyme activities decreased to a minimum after 4 days and recovered within 14 days to initial values. In the stomach, the activities of endo- and exochitinase increased when krill were fed on Cyclotella. For animals fed with Dunaliella, activities stayed constant or decreased slightly. The results confirm chitinases as digestive enzymes and, therefore, the capability of krill to utilize various food sources.},

All characterized family members are directly photosensitive and include plant blue light photoreceptors. We show that cry transcription is under circadian regulation, influenced by the Drosophila clock genes period, timeless, Clock, and cycle. We also show that cry protein levels are dramatically affected by light exposure. Importantly, circadian photosensitivity is increased in a cry-overexpressing strain. These physiological and genetic data therefore link a specific photoreceptor molecule to circadian rhythmicity. Taken together with the data in the accompanying paper, we propose that CRY is a major Drosophila photoreceptor dedicated to the resetting of circadian rhythms.},

	abstract = {In every eukaryotic organism, unidirectional cell cycle progression is driven by controlled proteolysis. Here, we present the identification of two ubiquitin ligase complexes in the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, the SCF and APC/C, being important for temporal controlled degradation of key cell division proteins. We annotated and analyzed the conservation of all subunits of both complexes in P. tricornutum. Expression analysis during a synchronized cell cycle showed that the SCF complex subunits are transcribed at the G1-to-S phase transition. In contrast, expression of the APC/C subunits is relatively constant, except for its activators that are differentially expressed: CDC20 is highly expressed at mitosis, while CDH1 is transcribed at late M and during G1, suggesting temporal activation of the different complexes. Furthermore, we performed in silico prediction of APC/C targets through destruction box (D-box) and KEN box analysis, two known degrons for substrate recognition of the APC/C complexes. For this, we focused on the expanded set of diatom cyclins, including the diatom-specific cyclins. Interestingly, we could find D-boxes for most mitotically expressed cyclins, but also some of the G1/S cyclins. Thus, it appears that in analogy with what is known in other organisms, tight post-translational control of the diatom cyclins might contribute to the well-coordinated cell cycle progression.},

	abstract = {Many species of euphausiids (Euphausiacea, Crustacea) are distinguished by subtle or geographically variable morphological characters, and erroneous identification of euphausiid species may be more frequent than currently acknowledged. DNA barcodes (short DNA sequences that discriminate species and aid in recognition of unknown species) are of use for this group. A ∼650 bp region of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI) was sequenced for 40 species of 10 euphausiid genera: Bentheuphausia, Euphausia, Meganyctiphanes, Nematobrachion, Nematoscelis, Nyctiphanes, Stylocheiron, Tessarabrachion, Thyssanoessa and Thysanopoda. mtCOI sequence variation discriminated all species; pairwise differences averaged 16.4\% (range 7–24\%); mean generalized time reversible (GTR) genetic distance was 26.7\%. mtCOI reliably identified euphausiid species: variation within species was typically {\textless} 1\% and GTR distance was typically {\textless} 2\%. Atlantic and Pacific Ocean populations of Euphausia brevis differed by 13\% (GTR genetic distance = 28\%) and may deserve status as distinct species. mtCOI gene trees were reconstructed for five genera using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian algorithms; best-fit models of nucleotide evolution were determined for each genus. The mtCOI gene tree for 20 species of Euphausia reproduced one of three morphologically defined species groups. mtCOI resolved relationships among closely related species of most genera, usually in accord with morphological groupings. A comprehensive DNA barcode database for euphausiids will help ensure accurate species identification, recognition of cryptic species and evaluation of taxonomically meaningful geographic variation.},

The survey progressed from 80°E in late January to 150°E in mid March. Krill varied in mean size across the survey area, and the various maturity stages showed some longitudinal and latitudinal trends. Males, early stage females, and juveniles were, on average, larger in the east of the survey area whereas gravid and spent females differed little in length across the survey area. Gravid females were only found north of the shelf break; juveniles, males and other stages of females were found throughout the latitudinal extent of the survey. Growth rate measurements resulted in comparable figures to other studies in the Indian Ocean and were greatest in February for all stages. Observed growth rates were sufficient to account for the changes in mean sizes of krill observed across the survey area. The mean density of krill revealed by nets (2.65 krill per 1000 m−3) was low compared to other areas that have been surveyed. Similarly, the overall estimates of proportional recruitment were below average when compared to the range of reported values. Krill larvae were moderately abundant in the survey area but were more frequently encountered in the east, which is probably a function of the lateness of the season when the larvae would be rising into the surface layer sampled by the net.},

In this study, 6 species of Antarctic invertebrate covering 4 phyla, Echinodermata, Mollusca, Brachiopoda and Crustacea were subjected to acclimation trials at 3$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C for 60 days. Using acute upper lethal temperatures as a metric of ability to acclimate, only one species (Marseniopsis mollis) increased its acute upper limit. Furthermore, analysis of oxygen consumption on the urchin Sterechinus neumayeri and the amphipod Paraceradocus gibber showed their metabolic rates were also not compensated over the 60-day exposure period. Thus, 5 out of 6 species failed to accli-mate to temperatures only 3.5$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C above the annual average and 1-2$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C above current summer maximum values. We discuss the proposal that the abilities of Antarctic marine species to adjust to elevated environmental temperatures are as limited, if not more so, than tropical species.},

We attempted to distinguish between errors arising from changes in calcium ion activity and those due to interferences in the electrode response. Variation in sodium ion concentration over the range 100--180 mmol/liter produces changes in apparent ionized-calcium concentration that are largely attributable to activity effects for the Radiometer and Simon electrodes. The Orion electrode is subject to an additional sodium-interference effect. Apparent ionized calcium concentration measurements are independent of pH for the Radiometer electrode but not for the Orion electrode; the Simon electrode exhibits intermediate pH response, which is probably clinically negligible. Magnesium and potassium ions have little effect on ionized calcium concentration measurements, particularly when these ions are incorporated into calibration standards.},

	abstract = {In September 1995, dense aggregations of large scyphomedusae (mainly Chrysaoramelanaster) were observed in 27 midwater deployments of a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) near the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea. Age-0 walleye pollock Theragrachalcogramma appeared to be frequently associated with these gelatinous zooplankton. During daytime, up to 30 pollock were observed swimming within the tentacles of these medusae, but when approached by the ROV, the pollock generally left the vicinity of the jellyfish. At night, few such associations were observed and juvenile pollock moved closer to the surface, apparently feeding in loose aggregations, while the medusae remained close to the thermocline (35-40 m). Prowfish Zaprorasilenus were also observed near large medusae, but tended to be found closer to the bell rather than within the tentacles. The lack of any gelatinous material in the stomachs of the pollock suggests that juvenile pollock associate to gain shelter from predation or possibly as a thigmotactic response to biotic structure. The implications of this commensal behavior with gelatinous zooplankton are discussed relative to pollock recruitment in the Eastern Bering Sea.},

Lipid composition was dominated by phospholipids in most species. However, energy storage lipids (triacylglycerols and wax esters) contributed {\textgreater}50\% to the total lipids in the lysianassid amphipods and the unidentified caridean shrimp, and lipids made up 19 and 45\% of amphipod and 14\% of shrimp dry mass, suggesting sporadic feeding and the need for energy storage. The dominant sterol was cholesterol. The presence of phytosterols in the anemone, the polychaetes and Munidopsis sp. suggested consumption of phytodetritus, but none of the specimens had levels suggesting that phytodetritus was their main food resource. The levels of essential photosynthetically derived polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) corroborated the sterol results. The ratio of 18:1ω9/18:1ω7 further suggested carnivory as the predominant mode of foraging in the abyssal animals, although to varying degrees. Some distinct differences in the fatty acid (FA) composition of these animals allowed for their separation, confirming that FA profiles will be useful in future biomarker approaches to deep-sea food web studies.},

	doi = {10.1098/rspb.2011.0542},
	abstract = {The extent to which acclimation and genetic adaptation might buffer natural populations against climate change is largely unknown. Most models predicting biological responses to environmental change assume that species' climatic envelopes are homogeneous both in space and time. Although recent discussions have questioned this assumption, few empirical studies have characterized intraspecific patterns of genetic variation in traits directly related to environmental tolerance limits. We test the extent of such variation in the broadly distributed tidepool copepod Tigriopus californicus using laboratory rearing and selection experiments to quantify thermal tolerance and scope for adaptation in eight populations spanning more than 17$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$ of latitude. Tigriopus californicus exhibit striking local adaptation to temperature, with less than 1 per cent of the total quantitative variance for thermal tolerance partitioned within populations. Moreover, heat-tolerant phenotypes observed in low-latitude populations cannot be achieved in high-latitude populations, either through acclimation or 10 generations of strong selection. Finally, in four populations there was no increase in thermal tolerance between generations 5 and 10 of selection, suggesting that standing variation had already been depleted. Thus, plasticity and adaptation appear to have limited capacity to buffer these isolated populations against further increases in temperature. Our results suggest that models assuming a uniform climatic envelope may greatly underestimate extinction risk in species with strong local adaptation.},

	abstract = {The Antarctic Peninsula is experiencing one of the fastest rates of regional climate change on Earth, resulting in the collapse of ice shelves, the retreat of glaciers and the exposure of new terrestrial habitat. In the nearby oceanic system, winter sea ice in the Bellingshausen and Amundsen seas has decreased in extent by 10\% per decade, and shortened in seasonal duration. Surface waters have warmed by more than 1 K since the 1950s, and the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current has also warmed. Of the changes observed in the marine ecosystem of the western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region to date, alterations in winter sea ice dynamics are the most likely to have had a direct impact on the marine fauna, principally through shifts in the extent and timing of habitat for ice-associated biota. Warming of seawater at depths below ca 100 m has yet to reach the levels that are biologically significant. Continued warming, or a change in the frequency of the flooding of CDW onto the WAP continental shelf may, however, induce sublethal effects that influence ecological interactions and hence food-web operation. The best evidence for recent changes in the ecosystem may come from organisms which record aspects of their population dynamics in their skeleton (such as molluscs or brachiopods) or where ecological interactions are preserved (such as in encrusting biota of hard substrata). In addition, a southwards shift of marine isotherms may induce a parallel migration of some taxa similar to that observed on land. The complexity of the Southern Ocean food web and the nonlinear nature of many interactions mean that predictions based on short-term studies of a small number of species are likely to be misleading.},

	abstract = {Feeding dynamics of the Antarctic salps Ihlea racovitzai and Salpa thompsoni were studied in the Lazarev Sea in fall 2004, summer 2005–2006 and winter 2006. Pigment concentrations in the guts of both species were positively correlated with ambient surface chlorophyll a (chl a). No evidence was found for salp clogging even at dense surface concentrations of up to 7 μg chl a L−1. However, gut pigment concentrations had a lower range than ambient pigment concentrations, suggesting that salps increased retention times of ingested material in low-food environments. For medium-sized I. racovitzai and S. thompsoni, estimated individual daily rations reached 7–10 and {\textgreater}100\% of body carbon in winter and summer, respectively. Daily respiratory needs of I. racovitzai and S. thompsoni accounted for 28 and 22\% of daily carbon assimilation based on pigment ingestion rates in winter, and for 2 and 1\% in summer, respectively. The grazing impact of the salp populations on the phytoplankton standing stock was negligible during all seasons due to generally low salp densities. Fatty acid trophic biomarkers in the salps suggest high year-round contributions of flagellates and modest contributions of diatoms to the salp’s diet. These markers showed low seasonal variability for I. racovitzai. The more pronounced seasonality of trophic markers in S. thompsoni were likely related to their generally deeper residence depth in winter linked to a seasonal alternation of sexual and asexual generations.},

The zooplankton community was numerically dominated by copepods (58–98\% of the total abundance). Zooplankton abundance ranged from 115 individuals m−3 at the northern most location to 12,296 individuals m−3 on the shelf. Cluster analysis revealed four different groups with distinct geographic integrity that were identified by variation in species densities rather than by variation in taxonomic composition. Water temperature and salinity differed significantly between the different cluster groups indicating that part of the observed variations in species distribution relate to differences in hydrography. Numerous significant regressions between zooplankton abundance at species level and hydrographical parameters suggest that variability in water masses has measurable effects on zooplankton distribution and species composition in the study area.},

	abstract = {Locusta migratoria is a classic hemimetamorphosis insect and has caused widespread economic damage to crops as a migratory pest. Researches on the expression pattern of functional genes in L. migratoria have drawn focus in recent years, especially with the release of genome information. Real-time quantitative PCR is the most reproducible and sensitive approach for detecting transcript expression levels of target genes, but optimal internal standards are key factors for its accuracy and reliability. Therefore, it's necessary to provide a systematic stability assessment of internal control for well-performed tests of target gene expression profile. In this study, twelve candidate genes (Ach, Act, Cht2, EF1α, RPL32, Hsp70, Tub, RP49, SDH, GAPDH, 18S, and His) were analyzed with four statistical methods: the delta Ct approach, geNorm, Bestkeeper and NormFinder. The results from these analyses aimed to choose the best suitable reference gene across different experimental situations for gene profile study in L. migratoria. The result demonstrated that for different developmental stages, EF1α, Hsp70 and RPL32 exhibited the most stable expression status for all samples; EF1α and RPL32 were selected as the best reference genes for studies involving embryo and larvae stages, while SDH and RP49 were identified for adult stage. The best-ranked reference genes across different tissues are RPL32, Hsp70 and RP49. For abiotic treatments, the most appropriate genes we identified were as follows: Act and SDH for larvae subjected to different insecticides; RPL32 and Ach for larvae exposed to different temperature treatments; and Act and Ach for larvae suffering from starvation. The present report should facilitate future researches on gene expression in L. migratoria with accessibly optimal reference genes under different experimental contexts},

	abstract = {Wound debridement, the removal of necrotic tissue, can be achieved with proteolytic enzymes. Recently, a new multi-enzyme preparation, krill enzyme, isolated from Antarctic shrimp-like organisms (Euphausia superba), was reported to possess powerful proteolytic activity towards protein substrates. In this paper, we study the in vitro digestive properties of krill enzymes towards whole tissue, compared with placebo, papain, and fibrinolysin/DNAse. Freshly obtained skin specimens were exposed for 3 days to krill enzymes (3; 0.6 and 0.06 U/ml), papain (120; 60; 6 and 0.6 U/ml), fibrinolysin/DNAse (2.5/1500 E and 1/600 E), and phosphate-buffered saline control solution. Tissue digestion was estimated by measuring wet wt, dry wt, and histological examination. After 72 hr of exposure to 3 U/ml krill enzymes, the dry wt of the specimens was reduced to 2.7\% +/- 1.9 (SEM, n = 5), compared with 31.0\% +/- 2.7 for placebo, 25.7\% +/- 2.5 for 120 U/ml papain, and 24.5\% +/- 3.3 for 2.5/1500 E/ml fibrinolysin/DNAse. The differences between krill enzymes and fibrinolysin/DNAse, papain, and control solution were statistically significant (p {\textless} 0.007). These data suggest that krill enzymes are more active than other commonly available proteolytic agents used for wound debridement.},

Terrestrial and aerial aggregations can be observed directly, and photographic techniques have provided insights into the behaviors of animals in these environments and data against which behavioral theory can be tested. Underwater, however, limited visibility can hamper direct observation, and understanding of shoaling remains incomplete. We used multibeam sonar to observe three-dimensional structure of Antarctic krill shoals acoustically. Shoal size and packing density varied greatly, but surface area:volume ratios (roughnesses) were distributed narrowly about 3.3 m(-1). Shoals of clupeid fish (e.g., sardine, anchovy) from geographically and oceanographically diverse locations have very similar roughnesses. This common emergent shape property suggests common driving forces across diverse ecosystems. Group behavior can be complex, but a simple tradeoff–that we model–in which individual fish and krill juggle only their access to oxygen-replete water and exposure to predation can explain the observed shoal shape. Decreasing oxygen availability in a warming world ocean may impact shoal structure: because structure affects catchability by predators and fishers, understanding the response will be necessary for ecological and commercial reasons.},

Euphausia superba makes an abrupt behavioral transition after the last larval molt from an individualistic, planktonic lifestyle to that of a highly social, nektonic juvenile. Then and throughout the rest of its life, most aspects of krill behavior are expressed within the context of highly organized, polarized schools. A krill school is an integrated whole that displays properties greater than the sum of its parts. Emergent attributes of the aggregate evolve in response to a suite of positive and negative selective factors that act on entire schools as well as individuals. We evaluate the individual advantages and disadvantages of living within large schools of conspecific euphausiids primarily for foraging, antipredator behavior, and epidemiology. We review the history of research on krill behavior, comment on the current state of knowledge, and suggest new avenues for ..., On trouvera ici une revue de certains aspects de l'éthologie des euphausiidés pélagiques, en particulier de la biologie comportementale du krill antarctique (Euphausia superba). Après sa dernière mue larvaire, Euphausia superba troque abruptement son mode de vie planctonique et individualiste pour une vie juvénile nectonique et hautement sociale. À partir de ce moment et pour le reste de sa vie, le krill a un comportement qui s'exprime presque toujours dans le contexte de bancs très organisés et polarisés. Un banc de krill forme un tout intégré dont les propriétés collectives dépassent la somme des propriétés individuelles. Les attitudes collectives apparaissent et évoluent en réaction à une séquence de facteurs sélectifs positifs et négatifs qui agissent tant sur le banc que sur les individus.

Euphausia superba structural lipids showed little mesoscale variability. Specific differences between phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine fatty acid composition exceeded variability re- lated to sampling stations. On a larger scale (Southern Ocean), fatty acid composition of both total polar lipids and phosphatidylcholine confirmed the reduced level of regional variability. Similar comparisons between female M. norvegica collected at two extreme sites in terms of temperature regime (Kattegat and Ligurian Sea) during two seasons (springsummer and fallwinter) suggested a more complex picture. Levels of phosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylcholine, and diphosphatidylglycerol showed significant differences between sites. During spring summer, a lower content of phosphatidylethanolamine and lysophosphatidylcholine was observed for the Ligurian Sea population. Fatty acid composition of total polar lipids was significantly different at both sites. Comparisons between springsummer populations at both sites showed higher percentages of 22:6n3 and a lower content in saturated and monoenoic acids for the Ligurian Sea, suggesting some degree of adaptation to temperature regime.},

	abstract = {Data on hydrography, phyto- and zooplankton, obtained on a transect along the 0° meridian during the Winter Weddell Gyre Study, June 1992, revealed peculiarities of the early winter situation in the eastern Weddell Gyre. The vertical distribution and developmental stage composition of Rhincalanus gigas, Calanoides acutus, Calanus propinquus and krill, Euphausia superba larvae, were a good index for a general assessment of the seasonal condition of the plankton communities. There were five zones differing in seasonal situation: (1) The Polar Front and the southern ACC (not studied in detail), (2) The Weddell Front, (3) The Weddell Gyre interior, (4) The Maud Rise area, and (5) The Coastal Current zone. In the Weddell Front, the planktonic community resembled an autumnal situation with moderate phytoplankton biomass; the overwintering stock of copepods was not completely formed and the occurrence of calyptopes larvae of E. superba indicated that krill continued to reproduce until May. In the Weddell Gyre interior, a typical winter plankton community was found even before sea ice had formed. The specific hydrographic regime of the Maud Rise (governed by the mesoscale circulation over the seamount) support the late autumn conditions similar to the Weddell Front (but without early krill larvae). The plankton of the Coastal Current was a winter community. We conclude that in the eastern part of the Weddell Front (compared to the western part) seasonal development of both phytoplankton and herbivorous zooplankton is delayed in spring but prolonged in late autumn. Furthermore, it appears that the Weddell Sea ecosystem exhibits a much higher degree of spatial and temporal variability than thought before. This may have an impact on seasonal pattern of organic carbon transport from the pelagic realm to deeper water layers and to the sediment.},

	abstract = {Phenology, the study of annually recurring life cycle events such as the timing of migrations and flowering, can provide particularly sensitive indicators of climate change. Changes in phenology may be important to ecosystem function because the level of response to climate change may vary across functional groups and multiple trophic levels. The decoupling of phenological relationships will have important ramifications for trophic interactions, altering food-web structures and leading to eventual ecosystem-level changes. Temperate marine environments may be particularly vulnerable to these changes because the recruitment success of higher trophic levels is highly dependent on synchronization with pulsed planktonic production. Using long-term data of 66 plankton taxa during the period from 1958 to 2002, we investigated whether climate warming signals are emergent across all trophic levels and functional groups within an ecological community. Here we show that not only is the marine pelagic community responding to climate changes, but also that the level of response differs throughout the community and the seasonal cycle, leading to a mismatch between trophic levels and functional groups.},

	abstract = {The coordination of biological activities into daily cycles provides an important advantage for the fitness of diverse organisms. Most eukaryotes possess an internal clock ticking with a periodicity of about one day to anticipate sunrise and sunset. The 24-hour period of the free-running rhythm is highly robust against many changes in the natural environment. Among prokaryotes, only Cyanobacteria are known to harbor such a circadian clock. Its core oscillator consists of just three proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC that produce 24-hour oscillations of KaiC phosphorylation, even in vitro. This unique three-protein oscillator is well documented for the freshwater cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. Several physiological studies demonstrate a circadian clock also for other Cyanobacteria including marine species. Genes for the core clock components are present in nearly all marine cyanobacterial species, though there are large differences in the specific composition of these genes. In the first section of this review we summarize data on the model circadian clock from S. elongatus PCC 7942 and compare it to the reduced clock system of the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus marinus MED4. In the second part we discuss the diversity of timing mechanisms in other marine Cyanobacteria with regard to the presence or absence of different components of the clock.},

	volume = {51},
	abstract = {We used the instantaneous growth rate method to determine the effects of food, temperature, krill length, sex, and maturity stage on in situ summer growth of krill across the southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. The main aims were to examine the separate effects of each variable and to generate a predictive model of growth based on satellite-derivable environmental data. Both growth increments in length on moulting (GIs) and daily growth rates (DGRs, mm d21) ranged greatly among the 59 swarms, from 0.5815\% and 0.0130.32 mm d21. However, all swarms maintained positive mean growth, even those in the low chlorophyll a (Chl a) zone of the central Scotia Sea. Among a suite of indices of food quantity and quality, large-scale monthly Chl a values from SeaWiFS predicted krill growth the best. Across our study area, the great contrast between bloom and nonbloom regions was a major factor driving variation in growth rates, obscuring more subtle effects of food quality. GIs and DGRs decreased with increasing krill length and decreased above a temperature optimum of 0.58C. This probably reects the onset of thermal stress at the northern limit of krill's range. Thus, growth rates were fastest in the ice edge blooms of the southern Scotia Sea and not at South Georgia as previously suggested. This reects both the smaller size of the krill and the colder water in the south being optimum for growth. Males tended to have higher GIs than females but longer intermoult periods, leading to similar DGRs between sexes. DGRs of equivalent-size krill tended to decrease with maturity stage, suggesting the progressive allocation of energy toward reproduction rather than somatic growth. Our maximum DGRs are higher than most literature values, equating to a 5.7\% increase in mass per day. This value ®ts within a realistic energy budget, suggesting a maximum carbon ration of ;20\% d21. Over the whole Scotia Sea/South Georgia area, the gross turnover of krill biomass was ;1\% d21.},

	abstract = {Shallow coastal marine waters are generally considered highly productive and important as nursery grounds. In this study a new sampling device, a portable drop trap, is introduced. This allows quantitative sampling with high accuracy and statistically precise assessment in defined sampling areas. The production, abundance, biomass, and horizontal dispersion of the following dominant and mobile epifaunal species have been assessed over several years in two bays with a sandy-silt substratum in western Sweden: Crangon crangon (Fabricius), Carcinus maenas (L.), Pleuronectes platessa (L.), Pomatoschistus microps (Krøyer) and P. minutus (Pallas).

Recruitment of the 0-group began in April with Pleuronectes and was followed in early July by the other species. This latter immigration often occurred in waves and a separation was then made into cohorts based on lengths or widths. One year with a severe winter delayed the immigration of these species, but did not reduce the total annual production. Crangon was the dominant species and its annual maximum mean abundance was between 55 and 90 ind. ·m−2. The total mean epifaunal abundance and biomass could well exceed 50 ind. ·m−2 and 1.2 g (ash-free dry weight, AFDW) ·m−2 over several months. The total annual production in one of the bays varied over a 4-yr period between 3.8 and 5.0 g AFDW ·m−2, corresponding to 25 g fresh wt. Despite considerable intraspecific variation of abundance and production between the 0- and 1-groups of crabs and of shrimps the annual production of Crangon and Carcinus combined was between 3.5 and 4.0 g AFDW ·m−2. It is suggested that the areas studied have an intrinsic carrying capacity for these species, which partly could be regulated within the species.

The short season in Sweden is clearly reflected in that almost 90\% of the annual epifaunal production occurred during 4 months, and \&gt;50\% during August and September of each year. Nevertheless, the annual production and the mean maximum abundance of these mobile species were at least as great as the highest so far recorded in Europe.},

We propose that the broad spectrum of activities previously attributed to CSN subunits—including repression of photomorphogenesis, activation of JUN, and activation of p27 nuclear export—underscores the importance of dynamic cycles of NEDD8 attachment and removal in biological regulation.},

Fecundity estimates were determined based on counts of mature oocytes in the ovary of females in preserved field samples. Principal components analysis and allometry were used to analyze the covariation of egg-batch size with female characteristics. In both krill species, egg-batch size scaled isometrically with ovarian weight but showed a positive allometry with body size. Predicted egg-batch size ranged from 200 to 4000 eggs for M. norvegica of 25.5-35 mm body length and from 1500 to 6000 eggs for E. superba of 36-55 mm. Allometric relationships can be used to predict annual fecundity from size structure data of krill populations. In this study, the effect of temperature on the duration of molting and spawning cycles was used to infer a number of reproductive cycles per year. taking into account climate and seasonal variation.},

At stations where swarms of adults occurred, average abundances attained levels of 450–689 ind. 1000 m−3. Gut content analysis showed that during December micro- and mesozooplankton were the dominant components of the diet of E. crystallorophias, comprising on average 75\% of the total number of identifiable food items. During January, however, the heterotrophic component of the diet decreased sharply and phytoplankton cells accounted for 68\% of the total number of food particles. This suggests that E. crystallorophias may exhibit a predominantly carnivorous habit during austral spring. However, at the onset of the spring phytoplankton bloom, this species seems able to switch to a truly omnivorous habit.},

In summer, during the spawning season the krill stock shows a spatial succession of developmental stages along the Peninsula from inner shelf (juveniles) to oceanic waters (adults). A temporal succession of abundance is observed from early spring (mostly juveniles) to summer (all stages) in occurrence of developmental stages and absolute krill abundance in the area. Within a given year average krill abundance differs by more than an order of magnitude, depending on the month of sampling, thus masking a possible interannual variability in the Peninsula region. Seasonal fluctuation in abundance and spatial distribution patterns are discussed as possible effects of seasonal changes in the location of the atmospheric pressure zones (influencing currents and drift of krill) as well as migration of krill.},

	abstract = {It is widely accepted that adaptation to the extreme cold has evolved at the expense of high thermal sensitivity. However, recent studies have demonstrated significant capacities for warm acclimation in Antarctic fishes. Here, we report on hepatic metabolic reorganization and its putative molecular background in the Antarctic eelpout (Pachycara brachycephalum) during warm acclimation to 5$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C over 6 wk. Elevated capacities of cytochrome c oxidase suggest the use of warm acclimation pathways different from those in temperate fish. The capacity of this enzyme rose by 90\%, while citrate synthase (CS) activity fell by 20\% from the very beginning. The capacity of lipid oxidation by hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase remained constant, whereas phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase as a marker for gluconeogenesis displayed 40\% higher activities. These capacities in relation to CS indicate a metabolic shift from lipid to carbohydrate metabolism. The finding was supported by large rearrangements of the related transcriptome, both functional genes and potential transcription factors. A multivariate analysis (canonical correspondence analyses) of various transcripts subdivided the incubated animals in three groups, one control group and two responding on short and long timescales, respectively. A strong dichotomy in the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-1α and -β receptors was most striking and has not previously been reported. Altogether, we identified a molecular network, which responds sensitively to warming beyond the realized ecological niche. The shift from lipid to carbohydrate stores and usage may support warm hardiness, as the latter sustain anaerobic metabolism and may prepare for hypoxemic conditions that would develop upon warming beyond the present acclimation temperature.},

	abstract = {Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) conditions are driving unprecedented changes in seawater chemistry, resulting in reduced pH and carbonate ion concentrations in the Earth’s oceans. This ocean acidification has negative but variable impacts on individual performance in many marine species. However, little is known about the adaptive capacity of species to respond to an acidified ocean, and, as a result, predictions regarding future ecosystem responses remain incomplete. Here we demonstrate that ocean acidification generates striking patterns of genome-wide selection in purple sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) cultured under different CO2 levels. We examined genetic change at 19,493 loci in larvae from seven adult populations cultured under realistic future CO2 levels. Although larval development and morphology showed little response to elevated CO2, we found substantial allelic change in 40 functional classes of proteins involving hundreds of loci. Pronounced genetic changes, including excess amino acid replacements, were detected in all populations and occurred in genes for biomineralization, lipid metabolism, and ion homeostasis—gene classes that build skeletons and interact in pH regulation. Such genetic change represents a neglected and important impact of ocean acidification that may influence populations that show few outward signs of response to acidification. Our results demonstrate the capacity for rapid evolution in the face of ocean acidification and show that standing genetic variation could be a reservoir of resilience to climate change in this coastal upwelling ecosystem. However, effective response to strong natural selection demands large population sizes and may be limited in species impacted by other environmental stressors.},

Previous studies suggest 3 kelvin (K) as the best estimate, 2 to 4.5 K as the 66\% probability range, and nonzero probabilities for much higher values, the latter implying a small chance of high-impact climate changes that would be difficult to avoid. Here, combining extensive sea and land surface temperature reconstructions from the Last Glacial Maximum with climate model simulations, we estimate a lower median (2.3 K) and reduced uncertainty (1.7 to 2.6 K as the 66\% probability range, which can be widened using alternate assumptions or data subsets). Assuming that paleoclimatic constraints apply to the future, as predicted by our model, these results imply a lower probability of imminent extreme climatic change than previously thought},

	abstract = {Certain of the rhythm mutations in Drosophila melanogaster lead to arrhythmic locomotor activity (and aperiodic eclosion) in constant conditions. In light-dark (LD) cycles, however, such mutants exhibit clear fluctuations between high levels of activity when the lights are on and much lower ones when they are off. Our data, in contrast to some previous conclusions, strongly suggest that period0 (per0 ) adults are, in LD conditions, merely being "forced" into exhibiting periodic behavior. These experiments involved application of 8-, 12-, 16-, and 24-hr LD cycles, in which the arrhythmic mutant could have any of these periodicities imposed upon it, whereas wild-type flies tended to exhibit periods of about 24 hr in cycling conditions whose T values were {\textgreater}8 hr different from 24. In phase-shift experiments, it was found that Drosophila expressing genotypes associated with rhythmicity achieved a 5-hr advance over a 2-day period following an advanced lights-on; per0 adults altered the phase of their locomotor peaks more rapidly. Against a background of the fact that eyeless or blind flies exhibit normal entrainment, it was hypothesized that double-mutant flies— carrying such visual mutations and per0 as well—should not synchronize to LD cycles, if the forced rhythms seen in the latter single-mutant type are mediated solely by light input through the external photoreceptors. Since an appreciable proportion of the double mutants did synchronize (to LD 12:12), it is thus suggested that the visual cues involved in forcing rhythmicity could be input through the same extraocular photoreceptors that, in general, subserve the fly's rhythm system.},

The analyses show that integrated sea ice chlorophyll apeaks in early spring and late austral summer, which is consistent with theories on light and nutrient limitation. The results indicate that on a circum-Antarctic scale, surface, internal and bottom sea ice layers contribute equally to integrated biomass, but vertical distribution shows distinct differences among six regions around the continent. The vertical distribution of sea ice algal biomass depends on sea ice thickness, with surface communities most commonly associated with thin ice ({\textless}0.4 m), and ice of moderate thickness (0.4–1.0 m) having the highest probability of forming bottom communities.},

Krill swam in polarised groups and responded as a group to objects that produced sharp contrasts but not to less distinct objects. Schools broke up when they encountered dense phytoplankton patches, and aggregated more tightly when kept with a white featureless background. The diel nature of school formation was observed under simulated natural light conditions with stronger and tighter schools during daytime and no obvious schooling behaviour during night. These behavioural patterns are further discussed in terms of their costs and benefits of feeding and predation risk, in conjunction with the diel vertical migration behaviour of krill.},

Quantitative aspects of distribution, biomass and demography were becoming more important since the late 1970s when a rapidly developing krill fishery started to exploit this unique resource. Since then, opinions have sometimes changed even on the appraisal of basic features such as small and large scale distribution or dispersion as well as on sea-sonal and interannual changes in biomass. Finally, the stability and size of the entire population had to be re-vised, which was believed to be relatively stable in a stable environment. Recent work has shown that the krill stocks are undergoing long-term changes and proximate and ultimate causes are still under discussion. Hence, it seems timely to review the current status of the discussion of sometime diverging interpretation of the results on krill distribution and stock dynamics for various spatial and temporal scales.},

	abstract = {To date, the association and synchronization between two organismal circadian clocks ticking in parallel as part of a meta-organism (termed a symbiotic association), have rarely been investigated. Reef-building corals exhibit complex rhythmic responses to diurnal, lunar, and annual changes. Understanding circadian, circatidal, and annual regulation in reef-building corals is complicated by the presence of photosynthetic endosymbionts, which have a profound physiochemical influence on the intracellular environment. How corals tune their animal-based clock machinery to respond to external cues while simultaneously responding to internal physiological changes imposed by the symbiont, is not clear. There is insufficient molecular or physiological evidence of the existence of a circadian pacemaker that controls the metabolism, photosynthesis, synchronized mass spawning, and calcification processes in symbiotic corals. In this review, we present current knowledge regarding the animal pacemaker and the symbiotic-algal pacemaker. We examine the evidence from behavioral, physiological, molecular, and evolutionary perspectives. We explain why symbiotic corals are an interesting model with which to study the complexities and evolution of the metazoan circadian clock. We also provide evidence of why the chronobiology of corals is fundamental and extremely important for explaining the biology, physiology, and metabolism of coral reefs. A deeper understanding of these complex issues can help explain coral mass spawning, one of the earth's greatest and most mysterious behavioral phenomena.},

	abstract = {The West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) and adjacent Scotia Sea support abundant wildlife populations, many of which were nearly extirpated by humans. This region is also among the fastest-warming areas on the planet, with 5-6 $^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C increases in mean winter air temperatures and associated decreases in winter sea-ice cover. These biological and physical perturbations have affected the ecosystem profoundly. One hypothesis guiding ecological interpretations of changes in top predator populations in this region, the "sea-ice hypothesis," proposes that reductions in winter sea ice have led directly to declines in "ice-loving" species by decreasing their winter habitat, while populations of "ice-avoiding" species have increased. However, 30 y of field studies and recent surveys of penguins throughout the WAP and Scotia Sea demonstrate this mechanism is not controlling penguin populations; populations of both ice-loving Adélie and ice-avoiding chinstrap penguins have declined significantly. We argue in favor of an alternative, more robust hypothesis that attributes both increases and decreases in penguin populations to changes in the abundance of their main prey, Antarctic krill. Unlike many other predators in this region, Adélie and chinstrap penguins were never directly harvested by man; thus, their population trajectories track the impacts of biological and environmental changes in this ecosystem. Linking trends in penguin abundance with trends in krill biomass explains why populations of Adélie and chinstrap penguins increased after competitors (fur seals, baleen whales, and some fishes) were nearly extirpated in the 19th to mid-20th centuries and currently are decreasing in response to climate change.},

The major environmental feature in this context is often temperature, and organisms across the planet vary widely in their capacity to cope with temperature variation.

The Antarctic bivalve mollusc Laternula elliptica and limpet Nacella concinna both survive a few days in experiments at 9-10 $^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C, but suffer 50\% failure in essential biological activities at 2-3 $^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C and complete loss at 5 $^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C. The Antarctic scallop Adamussium colbecki is even more sensitive, and loses the ability to swim as temperature approaches 2 $^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C. 3.These failures of activity are caused by a loss of aerobic capacity, and the animals investigated are so sensitive that a 2 $^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C rise in sea temperature could cause population or species removal from the Southern Ocean.},

A seasonal pattern was observed in microalgae, bacteria and protozoan abundance distribution. A maximum chlorophyll a concentration occurred during fall ice formation in the surface layer with the highest values at the near-shore station (100 to 215 µg l–1). A second maximum was observed before ice breaking in the bottom ice (50 to 90 µg l–1). Microalgal communities were dominated by diatoms ({\textgreater}86\% of the total cells), mainly represented by Fragilariopsis, Nitzschia, Navicula and Pseudo-nitzschia species. Fragilariopsis curta was the dominant species during the first bloom whereas Fragilariopsis cylindrus, Nitzschia longissima and Tropidoneis sp. were the main contributors during the second bloom at the bottom ice core. Maximum protozoan abundance was recorded during the fall bloom in the surface layer with dominance of ciliates, which contributed more than 75\% of total cell numbers. During this period, the maximum ciliate abundance was associated with the maximum bacteria and diatom numbers and microalgal biomass. The dramatic decrease of the ice algal biomass from south to north paralleled that of the underlying water phytoplankton available for new ice incorporation. The spatial algal biomass decrease could explain the parallel decrease in the abundance of bacteria and heterotrophic ciliates through trophic interactions.},

	abstract = {Functional involvement of a circadian clock in photoperiodism for measuring the length of day or night had been proposed more than 70 years ago, and various physiological experiments have supported the idea. However, the molecular basis of a circadian clock has remained veiled in insects. Nevertheless, our knowledge of the functional elements of a circadian clock governing circadian rhythmicity has advanced rapidly. Since both circadian rhythms and photoperiodism depend on the daily cycles of environmental changes, it is easy to assume that the same clock elements are involved in both processes. Recently, the RNA interference (RNAi) technique clarified that the molecular machinery of a circadian clock governing photoperiodism is identical to that governing circadian rhythmicity. Here, I review the theoretical background of photoperiodic responses incorporating a circadian clock(s) and recent progress on the molecular clockwork involved in photoperiodism in the bean bug Riptortus pedestris and other insect species. I have focused on the intense controversy regarding the involvement of a circadian clock in insect photoperiodism.},

	abstract = {In a previous study at South Georgia, carnivory was invoked as a cause of high polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba. To examine this, krill were sampled and fed for 16 days exclu- sively on the locally abundant copepod Drepanopus forcipatus. After 16 days, the krill had increased their PUFA con- tent from 28 to 54\% of the total fatty acids. Concurrently, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) decreased from 41 to 27\%. Thus, the krill appeared to accumulate PUFAs as reflected in their diet of D. forcipatus, which also had a relatively high PUFA content (50\%). Overall, the results support omnivorous feeding by krill at South Georgia during nonbloom periods. We propose that the ratio of PUFA to SFA content may be used to detect carnivory in the recent feeding history of krill and suggest that this may be an index which could be applied to other zooplankton.},

	abstract = {Kongsfjorden-Krossfjorden and the adjacent West Spitsbergen Shelf meet at the common mouth of the two fjord arms. This paper presents our most up-to-date information about the physical environment of this fjord system and identifies important gaps in knowledge. Particular attention is given to the steep physical gradients along the main fjord axis, as well as to seasonal environmental changes. Physical processes on different scales control the large-scale circulation and small-scale (irreversible) mixing of water and its constituents. It is shown that, in addition to the tide, run-off (glacier ablation, snowmelt, summer rainfall and ice calving) and local winds are the main driving forces acting on the upper water masses in the fjord system. The tide is dominated by the semi-diurnal component and the freshwater supply shows a marked seasonal variation pattern and also varies interannually. The wind conditions are characterized by prevailing katabatic winds, which at times are strengthened by the geostrophic wind field over Svalbard. Rotational dynamics have a considerable influence on the circulation patterns within the fjord system and give rise to a strong interaction between the fjord arms. Such dynamics are also the main reason why variations in the shelf water density field, caused by remote forces (tide and coastal winds), propagate as a Kelvin wave into the fjord system. This exchange affects mainly the intermediate and deep water, which is also affected by vertical convection processes driven by cooling of the surface and brine release during ice formation in the inner reaches of the fjord arms. Further aspects covered by this paper include the geological and geomorphological characteristics of the Kongsfjorden area, climate and meteorology, the influence of glaciers, freshwater supply, sea ice conditions, sedimentation processes as well as underwater radiation conditions. The fjord system is assumed to be vulnerable to possible climate changes, and thus is very suitable as a site for the demonstration and investigation of phenomena related to climate change.},

The triacylglycerols of M. norvegica were relatively rich in 20:1 and 22:1 fatty acids and its traces of wax esters resembled those of calanoid copepods. The triacylglycerols of both Thysanoessa species were deficient in 20:1 and 22:1 fatty acids but were richer in 16:1(n-7) and 18:1 (n-7) acids than those of M. norvegica. The wax esters of T. raschi contained phytol as almost the only fatty alcohol and were rich in 16:0 and 18:1 (n-9) fatty acids. The wax esters of T. inermis contained mainly 16:0 and 14:0 fatty alcohols with lesser amounts of phytol and their dominant fatty acid was 18:1, especially the (n-9) isomer. The triacylglycerols of T. inermis had 18:4 (n-3) as the major polyunsaturated fatty acid. From these and other aspects of fatty acid and fatty alcohol analyses it is concluded that a major foodstuff of M. norvegica in Balsfjorden is wax ester-rich calanoid copepods. T. raschi and especially T. inermis are concluded to have much more preference for phytoplanktonic food. Results are discussed in terms of current knowledge of the lipid chemistry of krill in the northern and southern hemispheres.},

	abstract = {Epigenetic modifications of DNA and histones are a primary mechanism by which gene expression activities may be modified in response to environmental stimuli. Here we characterize patterns of methyl-cytosine composition in the marine polychaete Spiophanes tcherniai from McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. We cultured adult worms at two temperatures, -1.5$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C (ambient control) and +4$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C (warm treatment), for 4 weeks. We observed a rapid capacity for S. tcherniai organismal respiration rates and underlying catalytic rates of citrate synthase at +4$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C to return to control levels in less than 4 weeks. We profiled changes in the methylation states of CpG sites in these treatments using an NGS strategy to computationally reconstruct and quantify methylation status across the genome. In our analysis we recovered 120,000 CpG sites in assembled contigs from both treatments. Of those, we were able to align 28,000 CpG sites in common between the two sample groups. In comparing these aligned sites between treatments, only 3000 (11\%) evidenced a change in methylation state, but over 85\% of changes involved a gain of a 5-methyl group on a CpG site (net increase in methyation). The ability to score CpG sites as partially methylated among gDNA copies in a sample opens up a new avenue for assessing DNA methylation responses to changing environments. By quantitatively distinguishing a "mixed" population of copies of one CpG site, we can begin to identify dynamic, non-binary, continuous-response reactions in DNA methylation intensity or density that previously may have been overlooked as noise},

	abstract = {Causal attribution of recent biological trends to climate change is complicated because non-climatic inuences dominate local, short-term biological changes. Any underlying signal from climate change is likely to be revealed by analyses that seek systematic trends across diverse species and geographic regions; however, debates within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveal several de®nitions of a `systematic trend'. Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented signi®cant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles (or metres per decade upward), and signi®cant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We de®ne a diagnostic ®ngerprint of temporal and spatial `sign-switching' responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic ®ngerprint was found for 279 species. This suite of analyses generates `very high con®dence' (as laid down by the IPCC) that climate change is already affecting living systems.},

These include separate bouts of morning and evening activity, characteristic of Drosophila melanogaster and many other taxa, including mammals. Whereas multiple oscillators have long been proposed to orchestrate such complex behavioural programmes, their nature and interplay have remained elusive. By using cell-specific ablation, we show that the timing of morning and evening activity in Drosophila derives from two distinct groups of circadian neurons: morning activity from the ventral lateral neurons that express the neuropeptide PDF, and evening activity from another group of cells, including the dorsal lateral neurons. Although the two oscillators can function autonomously, cell-specific rescue experiments with circadian clock mutants indicate that they are functionally coupled.},

This reduction in activity was more pronounced at higher temperatures of emersion (35{\textgreater} 15{\textgreater} 5 $^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C).

	volume = {62},
	abstract = {The utility of upper-trophic-level species as ecosystem indicators is determined by our ability to relate changes in indices of their performance to changes at lower trophic levels. Such relationships were assessed using indices of predator performance (response vectors) for four predator species, together with independent ship-based acoustic estimates of abundance of their main prey, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), from South Georgia in the South Atlantic Ocean. Out of 32 response vectors investigated, 13 showed a significant non-linear relationship, based on a Holling Type II response, to krill abundance, and just five showed a significant linear relationship. Predator responses reflecting the processes during summer, when prey surveys were undertaken, showed the closest relationship with prey abundance. Distinct relationships existed between the variability of indices and the biological processes they measured. Body mass variables had the lowest variability (CVs !10\%), whereas those measuring breeding success showed the greatest variability (CVs O50\%). Multivariate indices, produced by combining response vectors from all four predator species into a single combined index, provided a better fit with krill data than any of the individual vectors. Whereas population size parameters for individual species showed no relationship with annual estimates of krill abundance, a combined, multispecies population size index did show a significant response. Understanding the form of the relationship between concurrent indicators of prey abundance and key ecosystem metrics/ reference points, such as population size, is crucial to the application of monitoring data to management action.},

	abstract = {The 24-hr rhythms of behavior and other physiological functions are based upon an endogenous self-sustained oscillation. This is proven by experiments in which animals, kept in constant conditions, show a freerunning circadian period which deviates to a certain degree from that of the earth's rotation. The 24-hr rhythms of activity are furthermore characterized by typical patterns of which the one with two peaks in one period is most common. Under natural conditions, these two peaks of activity are often closely related to specific stimuli in the environment; e.g. to dawn and dusk. They have therefore been described as being directly caused by the environment. However, one may consider not only the circadian period but also the pattern part of an endogenous system. This hypothesis has been tested in experiments with finches. The results are: 1) Birds kept in artificial light-dark cycles show the same two-peak pattern either in cycles with interposed twilight or in cycles with rectangular changes between light and dark, 2) Under constant conditions, the second peak may disappear; but more often, it either remains or becomes more pronounced tan under conditions of a light-dark cycle. 3) With different levels of constant intensity of illumination, the birds show different circadian periods and different durations of activity; under those conditions, the two peaks keep the same proportional relationship to the activity time regardless of its duration. It is concluded that the basic two-peak pattern of locomotor activity is a persistent property of the circadian oscillating system.},

In this chapter, we discuss how patterns of abundance and distribution are affected by the life cycle characteristics of some of the predominant macrozooplankton west of the Antarctic Peninsula. Because of the importance of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, within this region, some aspects of its ecology are given speciel attention. of particular relevance to current hypotheses is the association of krill and sea ice, and new evidence is presented for winter habitat segregation between adult and larval stages. Subsequent discussion focuses on strategies for winter survival, and variation in recruitment. Finally, we discuss the effects of abiotic factors such as frontal shifts, and biotic factors such as food composition, as they relate to abundance and distribution of zooplankton.},

	abstract = {The association of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba with the under-ice habitat was investigated in the Lazarev Sea (Southern Ocean) during austral summer, autumn and winter. Data were obtained using novel Surface and Under Ice Trawls (SUIT), which sampled the 0-2 m surface layer both under sea ice and in open water. Average surface layer densities ranged between 0.8 individuals m(-2) in summer and autumn, and 2.7 individuals m(-2) in winter. In summer, under-ice densities of Antarctic krill were significantly higher than in open waters. In autumn, the opposite pattern was observed. Under winter sea ice, densities were often low, but repeatedly far exceeded summer and autumn maxima. Statistical models showed that during summer high densities of Antarctic krill in the 0-2 m layer were associated with high ice coverage and shallow mixed layer depths, among other factors. In autumn and winter, density was related to hydrographical parameters. Average under-ice densities from the 0-2 m layer were higher than corresponding values from the 0-200 m layer collected with Rectangular Midwater Trawls (RMT) in summer. In winter, under-ice densities far surpassed maximum 0-200 m densities on several occasions. This indicates that the importance of the ice-water interface layer may be under-estimated by the pelagic nets and sonars commonly used to estimate the population size of Antarctic krill for management purposes, due to their limited ability to sample this habitat. Our results provide evidence for an almost year-round association of Antarctic krill with the under-ice habitat, hundreds of kilometres into the ice-covered area of the Lazarev Sea. Local concentrations of postlarval Antarctic krill under winter sea ice suggest that sea ice biota are important for their winter survival. These findings emphasise the susceptibility of an ecological key species to changing sea ice habitats, suggesting potential ramifications on Antarctic ecosystems induced by climate change},

	abstract = {Medusae, siphonophores and ctenophores (here grouped as `pelagic coelenterates') interact with fish in several ways. Some interactions are detrimental to fish populations, such as predation by gelatinous species on pelagic eggs and larvae of fish, the potential competition for prey among pelagic coelenterates and fish larvae and zooplanktivorous fish species, and pelagic coelenterates serving as intermediate hosts for fish parasites. Other interactions are positive for fish, such as predation by fish on gelatinous species and commensal associations among fish and pelagic coelenterates. The interactions range from beneficial for the gelatinous species (food, parasite removal), to negative (predation on them). We review existing information and present new data on these topics. Although such interactions have been documented frequently, the significance to either fish or pelagic coelenterate populations is poorly understood. The effects of pelagic coelenterates on fish populations are of particular interest because of the great importance of fisheries to the global economy. As fishing pressures mount, it becomes increasingly important to understand how they may influence the balance between pelagic coelenterates and fish.},

	abstract = {Gene duplication is postulated to have played a major role in the evolution of biological novelty. Here, gene duplication is examined across levels of biological organization in an attempt to create a unified picture of the mechanistic process by which gene duplication can have played a role in generating biodiversity. Neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization have been proposed as important processes driving the retention of duplicate genes. These models have foundations in population genetic theory, which is now being refined by explicit consideration of the structural constraints placed upon genes encoding proteins through physical chemistry. Further, such models can be examined in the context of comparative genomics, where an integration of gene-level evolution and species-level evolution allows an assessment of the frequency of duplication and the fate of duplicate genes. This process, of course, is dependent upon the biochemical role that duplicated genes play in biological systems, which is in turn dependent upon the mechanism of duplication: whole genome duplication involving a co-duplication of interacting partners vs. single gene duplication. Lastly, the role that these processes may have played in driving speciation is examined. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev. Evol.) 306B, 2006. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.pocean.2006.09.007},
	abstract = {The Fram Strait is very important with regard to heat and mass exchange in the Arctic Ocean, and the large quantities of heat carried north by the West Spitsbergen Current (WSC) influence the climate in the Arctic region as a whole. A large volume of water and ice is transported through Fram Strait, with net water transport of 1.7–3.2 Sv southward in the East Greenland Current and a volume ice flux in the range of 0.06–0.11 Sv. The mean annual ice flux is about 866,000 km2 yr−1. The Kongsfjorden–Krossfjorden fjord system on the coast of Spitsbergen, or at the eastern extreme of Fram Strait, is mainly affected by the northbound transport of water in the WSC. Mixing processes on the shelf result in Transformed Atlantic Water in the fjords, and the advection of Atlantic water also carries boreal fauna into the fjords. The phytoplankton production is about 80 g C m−2 yr−1 in Fram Strait, and has been estimated both below and above this for Kongsfjorden. The zooplankton fauna is diverse, but dominated in terms of biomass by calanoid copepods, particularly Calanus glacialis and C. finmarchicus. Other important copepods include C. hyperboreus, Metridia longa and the smaller, more numerous Pseudocalanus (P. minutus and P. acuspes), Microcalanus (M. pusillus and M. pygmaeus) and Oithona similis. The most important species of other taxa appear to be the amphipods Themisto libellula and T. abyssorum, the euphausiids Thysanoessa inermis and T. longicaudata and the chaetognaths Sagitta elegans and Eukrohnia hamata. A comparison between the open ocean of Fram Strait and the restricted fjord system of Kongsfjorden–Krossfjorden can be made within limitations. The same species tend to dominate, but the Fram Strait zooplankton fauna differs by the presence of meso- and bathypelagic copepods. The seasonal and inter-annual variation in zooplankton is described for Kongsfjorden based on the record during July 1996–2002. The ice macrofauna is much less diverse, consisting of a handful of amphipod species and the polar cod. The ice-associated biomass transport of ice-amphipods was calculated, based on the ice area transport, at about 3.55 × 106 ton wet weight per year or about 4.2 × 105 t C yr−1. This represents a large energy input to the Greenland Sea, but also a drain on the core population residing in the multi-year pack ice (MYI) in the Arctic Ocean. A continuous habitat loss of MYI due to climate warming will likely reduce dramatically the sympagic food source. The pelagic and sympagic food web structures were revealed by stable isotopes. The carbon sources of particulate organic matter (POM), being Ice-POM and Pelagic-POM, revealed different isotopic signals in the organisms of the food web, and also provided information about the sympagic–pelagic and pelagic–benthic couplings. The marine food web and energy pathways were further determined by fatty acid trophic markers, which to a large extent supported the stable isotope picture of the marine food web, although some discrepancies were noted, particularly with regard to predator–prey relationships of ctenophores and pteropods.},

In situ measurements of sea-ice and snow properties were conducted at 15 ice stations, together with ship-based ASPeCt observations. The ice and snow thickness varied considerably in different regions of the pack ice, with particularly thick ice associated with deformation and a strong slope jet in the southwest of the study region. The mean ice thickness was 0.99 m (1.57 m excluding the northern marginal ice zones), but varied from 0.61 m along the southern leg to 1.80 m along the western leg, with pockets of considerably thicker ice in some regions. Swell was observed on two occasions penetrating more than 330 km south of the ice edge into regions with 80-100\% ice concentration. Ice thicknesses calculated from near coincident ICESat laser altimetry (1.74 m) are similar to the in-situ observations in the central pack (1.57 m).},

	abstract = {Circadian rhythms are ubiquitous on earth from cyanobacteria to land plants and animals. Circadian clocks are synchronized to the day/night cycle by environmental factors such as light and temperature. In eukaryotes, clocks rely on complex gene regulatory networks involving transcriptional regulation but also post-transcriptional and post-translational regulations. In multicellular organisms clocks are found at multiple levels from cells to organs and whole organisms, making the study of clock mechanisms more complex. In recent years the picoalga Ostreococcus has emerged as a new circadian model organism thanks to its reduced gene redundancy and its minimalist cellular organization. A simplified version of the “green” plant clock, involving the master clock genes TOC1 and CCA1, has been revealed when the functional genomics and mathematical model approaches were combined.

Specific photoreceptors such as a blue light sensing LOV histidine kinase mediate light input to the Ostreococcus clock. Non-transcriptional redox rhythms have also been identified recently in Ostreococcus and human red blood cells. This review highlights the progress made recently in the understanding of circadian clock architecture and function in Ostreococcus in the context of the marine environment.},

Cod stocks inhabiting the lower temperature range show generally an increase in recruitment with increasing temperature, while cod stocks inhabiting the uppermost part of the temperature range show a decrease in recruitment with increasing temperature. In the present paper possible functional relationships between temperature and cod recruitment mechanisms are analysed. Temperature influences the recruitment processes in a large number of ways; partly directly on vital rates in cod, and partly indirectly through trophic transfer. The copepod Caianus fin marchions is the dominant prey species for the early stages of cod. It proposed that the recruitment-temperature relation of Atlantic cod is a proxy for the food abundance during the early stages, and that advection of C.finmarchicus from the core production regions in the central parts of the North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre to the fringes where the cod stocks have their habitats explains the particular recruitment response to temperature.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to analyse the variability in the species composition and abundance of the metazooplankton community in different coastal areas of the Beagle Channel (southern tip of South America) during a seasonal cycle. Sampling was conducted during November (spring) 2005, March (summer), June (autumn) and September (winter) 2006 at 12 coastal stations. Copepods were the most abundant group throughout the study, and their assemblages were composed of a mixture of species typical of the south-western Atlantic, the south-eastern Pacific and the Southern Ocean. Among them, Oithona similis, Ctenocalanus citer and Drepanopus forcipatus were the dominant species. The copepod Acartia tonsa was the only taxon that displayed a spatial pattern of abundance, showing higher densities in areas with lower salinities. The community structure showed a strong temporal pattern. The metazooplankton community in March and June was mainly composed of copepods, while in November and September the community showed a greater diversity. In these two months high densities of meroplanktonic larvae were found, in coincidence with higher chlorophyll-a concentration. This temporal pattern seems to be more dependent on primary production than on physical factors such as temperature or salinity. The absence of a clear spatial pattern may suggest that the studied area of the Beagle Channel behaves as a semi-enclosed water body.},

In order to evaluate the effect of starvation on the total energy metabolism, the respiration rates of fed and unfed krill were determined. The FPLCelution profile of PK displayed two distinct peaks PK I and II. The first isoform represented 80\% of the total PK activity in the organism, and 20\% was contributed by the second isoform. PK I was inhibited by ATP but was not influenced by fructose1,6bisphosphate (FBP). In contrast, PK II showed ATP inhibition and up to 2.5-fold increased activity by addition of 17 μmoll1 FBP. The MichaelisMenten constants of both isoforms were 210-fold higher for ADP than for phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). Alanine showed no regulatory effect on PK I and II. In specimens starved for 7 days oxygen consumption decreased by 20\%. Neither the feeding experiments nor the animals captured in the field during low and high productive seasons indicate that PK properties of M.norvegica are modified in relation to food supply. Accordingly, alternative mechanisms are involved in the depression of the metabolic rate in terms of oxygen consumption.},

	abstract = {We investigated the seasonal vertical migration of seven dominant arctic copepod species from October 2007 to July 2008 in Amundsen Gulf. The large herbivore Calanus hyperboreus resided in the deep Atlantic Layer from December to mid-April, rapidly invaded the surface layer at the onset of the phytoplankton bloom in early May, and started its descent to overwintering depth in July. C. glacialis overwintered at shallower depths than C. hyperboreus, moved into the surface layer in early April as ice algae bloomed, and remained in the subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM) until late July. The small omnivore Oithona similis slowly rose into the Polar-Mixed Layer from February to April, reaching the ice–water interface in early April as ice algae developed. The very small Triconia borealis associated with C. hyperboreus in the Atlantic Layer from October to April. The mesopelagic omnivores Metridia longa and Microcalanus pygmaeus could be characterized as mid-depth interceptors, feeding on microzooplankton in winter, the upward flux of C. hyperboreus eggs in late winter-early spring, and on the rain of microalgae in spring-summer. The epipelagic Pseudocalanus spp. distributed in a narrow band centered around 50 m from October to April, then descended under the SCM from May to July. Copepods generally avoided the lens of warm (2–8°C) surface water in summer, but readily migrated across the −1.7°C to +0.3°C gradient from the Polar-Mixed Layer to the Atlantic Layer. The different patterns of seasonal migrations dictated the different temperature regimes experienced over the year by each species and copepodite stage.},

	abstract = {Ecological relationships of krill and whales have not been explored in the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), and have only rarely been studied elsewhere in the Southern Ocean. In the austral autumn we observed an extremely high density (5.1 whales per km(2)) of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) feeding on a super-aggregation of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in Wilhelmina Bay. The krill biomass was approximately 2 million tons, distributed over an area of 100 km(2) at densities of up to 2000 individuals m(-3); reports of such 'super-aggregations' of krill have been absent in the scientific literature for {\textgreater}20 years. Retentive circulation patterns in the Bay entrained phytoplankton and meso-zooplankton that were grazed by the krill. Tagged whales rested during daylight hours and fed intensively throughout the night as krill migrated toward the surface. We infer that the previously unstudied WAP embayments are important foraging areas for whales during autumn and, furthermore, that meso-scale variation in the distribution of whales and their prey are important features of this system. Recent decreases in the abundance of Antarctic krill around the WAP have been linked to reductions in sea ice, mediated by rapid climate change in this area. At the same time, baleen whale populations in the Southern Ocean, which feed primarily on krill, are recovering from past exploitation. Consideration of these features and the effects of climate change on krill dynamics are critical to managing both krill harvests and the recovery of baleen whales in the Southern Ocean.},

	abstract = {We investigated the seasonal occurrence, wet : dry : carbon : nitrogen weight ratios, population biomass, gastric pouch contents, and rates of feeding, growth and respiration of the scyphomedusa Aurelia aurita in the central part of the Inland Sea of Japan. Aurelia aurita medusae began to appear in January/February as ephyrae, reached annual maximum body size in July/August, and disappeared, presumably due to death, by November. Initial slow growth in early spring was followed by a period of exponential growth (mean growth rate: 0.069 d−1) between April and July. In the Ondo Strait, which is characterized by strong tidal mixing, the A. aurita population (mean carbon biomass: 66.0 mg C m−3) overwhelmingly dominated the zooplankton-community biomass (mean biomass of micro- and mesozooplankton: 23.7 mg C m−3) between May and early August The gastric content analysis revealed that A. aurita ate almost all micro- and mesozooplankters, of which small copepods were most important. On the basis of digestion time for small copepods (60 min) and their abundance in the gastric pouch of field-collected A. aurita, we determined the weight specific feeding rates and clearance rates. The former increases linearly with increasing copepod abundance, but the latter was relatively constant irrespective of the food supply. We also measured the respiration rates of A. aurita and expressed them as functions of body weight and temperature. These physio-ecological parameters enabled us to construct the carbon budget of the A. aurita population typical of early summer in the Ondo Strait. Predicted population-feeding rate (6.07 mg C m−3 d−1) was higher than the population-food requirement for both metabolism and growth (4.55 mg C m−3 d−1), indicating that food supply was sufficient to sustain the observed growth rate. This feeding rate was equivalent to 26\% of micro- and mesozooplankton biomass, a significant impact on zooplankton.},

Their density distributions have been described in the period 1926-51, while recent localized studies suggest short-term changes. To examine spatial and temporal changes over larger scales, we have combined all available scientific net sampling data from 1926 to 2003. This database shows that the productive southwest Atlantic sector contains {\textgreater}50\% of Southern Ocean krill stocks, but here their density has declined since the 1970s. Spatially, within their habitat, summer krill density correlates positively with chlorophyll concentrations. Temporally, within the southwest Atlantic, summer krill densities correlate positively with sea-ice extent the previous winter. Summer food and the extent of winter sea ice are thus key factors in the high krill densities observed in the southwest Atlantic Ocean. Krill need the summer phytoplankton blooms of this sector, where winters of extensive sea ice mean plentiful winter food from ice algae, promoting larval recruitment and replenishing the stock. Salps, by contrast, occupy the extensive lower-productivity regions of the Southern Ocean and tolerate warmer water than krill. As krill densities decreased last century, salps appear to have increased in the southern part of their range. These changes have had profound effects within the Southern Ocean food web.},

	abstract = {The paper explores the climate-dependent evolution of marine Antarctic fauna and tries to identify key mechanisms involved as well as the driving forces that have caused the physiological and life history characteristics observed today. In an integrative approach it uses the recent concept of oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance to identify potential links between molecular, cellular, whole-organism, and ecological characteristics of marine animal life in the Antarctic. As a generalized pattern, minimization of baseline energy costs, for the sake of maximized growth in the cold, appears as one over-arching principle shaping the evolution and functioning of Antarctic marine ectotherms. This conclusion is supported by recent comparisons with (sub-) Arctic ectotherms, where elevated levels of energy turnover result at unstable, including cold temperatures, and are related to wide windows of thermal tolerance and associated metabolic features. At biochemical levels, metabolic regulation at low temperatures in general, is supported by the cold compensation of enzyme kinetic parameters like substrate affinities and turnover numbers, through minute structural modifications of the enzyme molecule. These involve a shift in protein folding, sometimes supported by the replacement of individual amino acids. The hypothesis is developed that efficient metabolic regulation at low rates in Antarctic marine stenotherms occurs through high mitochondrial densities at low capacities and possibly enhanced levels of Arrhenius activation energies or activation enthalpies. This contrasts the more costly patterns of metabolic regulation at elevated rates in cold-adapted eurytherms. Energy savings in Antarctic ectotherms, largely exemplified in fish, typically involve low-cost, diffusive oxygen distribution due to high density of lipid membranes, loss of haemoglobin, myoglobin and the heat shock response, reduced anaerobic capacity, large myocytes with low ion exchange activities, and the use of lipid body stores for neutral buoyancy. Important trade-offs result from obligatory energy savings in the permanent cold: low metabolic rates support cold-compensated growth but imply narrow windows of thermal tolerance and reduced scopes for activity. The degree of thermal specialization is not uniformly defined by cold temperature but varies with life style characteristics and activity levels and associated aerobic scope. Trade-offs for the sake of cold compensated growth parallel reduced capacities for exercise performance, exacerbated by the effect of high haemolymph magnesium levels in crustaceans and, possibly, other invertebrates. High magnesium levels likely exclude the group of reptant decapod crustaceans from Antarctic waters below 0\&\#xa0;$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$C. The hypothesis is developed that energy savings imposed by the permanent cold bear specific life history consequences. Due to effects of allometry, energy savings are exacerbated at small body size, favouring passive lecithotrophic larvae. At all stages of life history, reduced energy turnover for the sake of growth causes delays and low rates in other higher functions, with the result of late maturity, fecundity and offspring release, as well as extended development. As a consequence, extended life spans evolved due to life history requirements. At the same time, polar gigantism is enabled by a combination of elevated oxygen levels in cold waters, of reduced metabolism and of extended periods of growth at slow developmental rates.},

	abstract = {Marine copepods commonly exhibit vertical movements in the water column over the diel cycle, termed diel vertical migration (DVM), with the most common pattern being an ascent in the water column to minimum depth around sunset and descent to maximum depth around sunrise. The present study characterized the DVM pattern of the pontellid copepod Calanopia americana Dahl in the Newport River estuary (North Carolina, USA, in July 2003). The estuary is shallow and well-mixed, and the study site (34°43′N; 76°40′W), 1.5 km inside the estuary entrance, is unusual in lying within a gyre where tidal currents are always in the seaward direction. Changes in C. americana vertical abundance were related to spectrally relevant changes in light throughout the diel cycle. Simultaneous measurements of light and zooplankton abundance near the surface (0.5 m depth) and near the bottom (0.5 m above bottom) were made over one 4-h period and two 3-day periods during different phases of the tide. These observations suggest that C. americana undertook twilight DVM in the Newport River estuary; an ascent to the surface occurred at sunset, followed by a descent to near the bottom around midnight, with a second ascent to the surface and then descent to near bottom at sunrise. DVM in C. americana was independent of the tidal cycle, with the initial ascent in the water column at sunset possibly associated with relative rates of irradiance change. Copepod vertical movements were consistent with a night-active endogenous rhythm, and appeared independent of the abundance of predatory chaetognaths, Sagitta spp. In DVM studies with migrators like C. americana that are broadly sensitive to visible wavelengths of light, measuring photosynthetically active radiation may be a reasonable alternative to measuring light in a spectrally relevant photometric unit.},

Our paper aims to investigate the global patterns of such impacts by projecting the distributional ranges of a sample of 1066 exploited marine fish and invertebrates for 2050 using a newly developed dynamic bioclimate envelope model. Our projections show that climate change may lead to numerous local extinction in the sub-polar regions, the tropics and semi-enclosed seas. Simultaneously, species invasion is projected to be most intense in the Arctic and the Southern Ocean. Together, they result in dramatic species turnovers of over 60\% of the present biodiversity, implying ecological disturbances that potentially disrupt ecosystem services. Our projections can be viewed as a set of hypothesis for future analytical and empirical studies.},

Molecular clock estimates for divergence times of Antarctic and sub-Antarctic species of Euphausia of {\textbackslash}textbackslash 15 million years ago were fairly close to the time of formation of the Antarctic Convergence, consistent with their vicariant speciation. However, the confidence limits quantified for these time estimates were large at {\textbackslash}textbackslash 11 million and {\textbackslash}textbackslash 25 million years. A divergence time of between {\textbackslash}textbackslash 10 million years for Euphausia triacantha and Euphausia longirostris suggested that migration across oceanographic fronts like the Antarctic Convergence may also lead to speciation in krill. Genetic differentiation between Euphausia vallentini and Euphausia lucens was found to be relatively minor and occurred between 0.76 million and 1.65 million years ago. These species have overlapping ranges, suggesting that there is potential for sympatric genetic differentiation in krill.},

The experiment had two different light intensity treatments: BRIGHT (1100 lx) and DIM (2 lx). At starting time, there were four groups of broodstock with four different ovarian maturation stages (II, III, IV and V) in each treatment. Results showed that light intensity plays an important role in controlling ovarian maturation of prawns, especially at the later stages (stages III and IV). Bright light showed an inhibitory effect, whereas dim light favoured ovarian maturation and spawning. Ovarian regression occurred in most stage III and stage IV prawns kept under bright light, while prawns at the same stages developed their ovaries further and spawned under dim light. Proportion of spawners (12.5\%), mean number of spawns per prawn (0.12) and mean fecundity (87,300) of prawns were significantly lower (P\&lt;0.05) in the BRIGHT treatment, compared to the DIM treatment. Under light intensity of 2 lx, 41.7\% of prawns spawned, producing 0.5 spawn per prawn on average with a mean fecundity of 117,300. The results also suggest that the sensitivity of broodstock to light increased from stages II to IV of ovarian maturation, while there were some evidence of light adaptation in stage V broodstock. This study confirmed multiple spawning of unablated P. merguiensis for the first time. Rematuration period was short (6–7 days).},

In a variable environment, species may show variations in sex ratio, breeding season, larval development, as well as functional characteristics such as natural mortality and pro- ductivity. Conceptual models based on results for some krill species indicate that environmental disturbances create in- stability in populations by reducing the recruitment success, which finally can lead to a decreasing population size.

Despite over three decades of research on Antarctic krill, the genetics of individual swarms is yet to be specifically investigated. In this study, we address the genetic diversity, population structure and demographic history of nine Antarctic krill swarms by sequencing 1173 bases of the gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1, COI) from 504 individuals. Both haplotype diversity (h 0.9974-1.0000) and nucleotide diversity (p 0.010275-0.011537) of Antarctic krill swarm samples was consistently high compared with popula-tions of other species reported in the literature. Analysis of molecular variance did not show any significant genetic structure, thus implying that the sampled swarms do not appear to reflect discrete genetic units. Fus Fs and Bayesian Skyride analyses provided strong evidence for a large increase in the population size of Antarctic krill, or selection favouring a particular mitochondrial lineage, within the last few 100 000 years (Pleistocene). The swarm-level results presented in this study not only further our understanding of Antarctic krill biology but, because of the economical importance of this species, also provide data to consider for future krill stock management.},

	abstract = {Metazoan zooplankton diversity is characterized for the oceanic environments of the Arctic Ocean, specifically the deep Nansen, Amundsen, Makarov and Canada Basins. Our species inventory is based on original records from 134 locations where stratified sampling of the entire water column was conducted from the surface to the bottom (or a maximum of 3,000 m) during seven icebreaker expeditions (RV Polarstern, 1993-2007, USCGC Healy, 2005) and two older expeditions of the Russian drifting ice stations North Pole 22 and 23 (1975-77). Representatives of eight large metazoan taxa, including Cnidaria, Ctenophora, Mollusca, Annelida, Nemertea, Crustacea, Chaetognatha, and Larvacea, all predominately oceanic species, are registered, with a total of 174 species. Crustaceans strongly dominate in terms of the species number (70\%), and copepods are the most diverse group amongst them. Comparison with the historical data suggests that the composition of epi- and mesopelagic zooplankton is relatively well characterized to date, while a considerable number of species we encountered in the bathypelagic layers were either unrecorded before, or undescribed. There appears to be no zoogeographical barrier between the Eurasian and Canadian basins throughout the entire depth range. All deep-water and endemic species are found on both sides of the Lomonosov Ridge, suggesting effective exchange of the deep fauna across the ridge. Notable differences in the species composition in the upper and midwater layers are related to the occurrence of Atlantic and Pacific expatriates advected with their respective waters either into the Eastern or Western Arctic. A pronounced increase in Pielou’s evenness (J'), Shannon’s diversity (H'), and Margalef’s species richness (d) indices with depth, with a maximum occurring within the Atlantic layer, followed by a decrease in the deeper layers, was typical for all deep basins. Species-specific depth preferences and ranges result in statistically distinct communities at different depths with high within-depth similarity (60-80\%). Differences were detectable between cruises in the epi- and mesopelagic layers (driven by the expatriates), but less so in the bathypelagic zone.},

	volume = {16},
	abstract = {Early conceptual models and global climate model (GCM) simulations both indicated the likelihood of an enhanced sensitivity to climate change in the polar regions, derived from the positive feedbacks brought about by snow and ice. As GCMs developed, however, the expected enhanced sensitivity has been more robust in the North Polar Region than the South Polar Region. Some recent increased-CO2 simulations, for instance, show little change in Southern Ocean sea ice extent and thickness and much less warming in the Southern Ocean region than in the sea ice regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Observations show a highly variable Southern Ocean ice cover that decreased significantly in the 1970s but, overall, has increased since the late 1970s. The increases are non-uniform, and in fact decreases occurred in the last three years of the 1979-2002 satellite record highlighted here. Regionally, the positive trends since the late 1970s are strongest in the Ross Sea, while the trends are negative in the Bellingshausen and Amundsen seas, a pattern that appears in greater spatial detail in maps of trends in the length of the sea ice season. These patterns correspond well with patterns of temperature trends, but there is a substantial way to go before they are understood (and can be modelled) in the full context of global change.},

Larval abundances were estimated from net catches and compared directly to visual counts (made by a SCUBA diver) of larvae occupying the ice habitat at the same sampling stations. The number of larvae per square meter sampled with nets was more often greater than that observed by the diver, irrespective of the sampling period. However, comparisons of larval abundance within sampling periods were not statistically significant. Larval krill collected by divers were significantly larger than those collected with nets for each of the three cruises. The stage composition of larval krill also depended on the collection method: net-collected samples contained a disproportionately high number of early furcilia larvae in June 1993 (early winter), and a disproportionately low number of early juveniles during September 1991 and 1993 (late winter). These results lead us to suggest that larval/juvenile krill occupy both the water column and sea ice habitat during the austral winter, and that there are often differences in the sizes and developmental stages of the two groups. For larval krill that occupied the sea ice habitat, aggregations were larger and more numerous during late winter than in early winter. In addition, larvae within aggregations occupied structurally complex microhabitats, provided by over-rafted ice floes, more often than they occupied smooth, downward-facing ice surfaces where ice was not over-rafted.},

	abstract = {The growth rates of postlarval krill (Euphausia superba) were measured across a wide range of environments in the Scotia Sea and around South Georgia using the Instantaneous Growth Rate (IGR) method. Each IGR experiment determined the intermolt period (IMP) and growth increment at molt (GI) of an average of 120 individuals incubated for 5 d in through-flowing ambient, filtered seawater. We examined the results from 51 IGR experiments involving 5,927 animals ranging between 25 mm and 62 mm. Animals were collected from an area that covered a latitudinal range of 10 degrees and surface temperatures of between -0.85 degrees C and 4.75 degrees C. The measurement of IMP has rarely been achieved in IGR experiments because synchronous molting biases estimates. We overcame this by applying a binary logistic regression model to Our data. This related IMP to temperature, body length, and Maturity stage. Food did not influence IMP. Our model estimated that krill within Our experiments had IMPs ranging from 9 d to 57 d. Temperature affected the IMP of females more than that of males. The IMPs of females were shortest around 2 degrees C and increased at lower and higher temperatures. IMP increased with body size and altered according to gender, with male IMPs being 50\% longer than those of equivalently sized females. One of the main assumptions of the IGR method is that the GI measured in the first few days reflects the in situ conditions experienced by krill in the previous intermolt period. However, we found that the GIs declined immediately and rapidly after capture, particularly when growth was initially high. Thus, conditions at time of molt also influence GI. We developed a method of correcting measured GIs to natural growth in field conditions. These refinements to IGR methodology (IMP and GI estimation) enable more accurate and precise predictions of krill growth rates in Summer to be made.},

Global spatial distributions and seasonal variability of ocean chlorophyll were similar, but global means decreased over the two observational segments. Major changes were observed regionally: chlorophyll concentrations decreased in the northern high latitudes while chlorophyll in the low latitudes increased. Mid-ocean gyres exhibited limited changes. The overall spatial and seasonal similarity of the two data records suggests that the changes are due to natural variability.

E. pacifica ingested cultured S. conicum at rates of 0.04 to 0.07 µgC krill-1 h-1 at low ciliate concentration and 1.01 to 3.24 µgC krill-1 h-1 at high ciliate concentration, when S. conicum was given as the sole prey. The daily ration on naked ciliates ranged from 0.02 to 1.8\% of body carbon when natural food assemblages enriched with S. conicum were given, and from 0.05 to 2.3\% of body carbon when S. conicum was given as the sole prey. Our results provide indirect evidence that E. pacifica ingests naked ciliates and plays a role in linking microbial food webs to the classical grazing food chains.},

	abstract = {We hypothesised that Antarctic krill acquire UV-absorbing mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) from dietary algae, which produce MAAs in response to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. To test this hypothesis, we grew cultures of Phaeocystis antarctica that had been grown under either photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400–750 nm) plus UV irradiation (UVR, 280–400 nm), or else PAR-only. Algae grown under PAR-only produced high concentrations of porphyra-334, whereas additional UVR caused formation of high concentrations of mycosporine-glycine:valine and lower concentrations of porphyra-334. Krill were fed with either of these two cultures on eight occasions over 63 days. A third group was starved for the duration of the experiment. Animals were analysed after 36 and 63 days for MAA content. Remaining animals from all treatments were starved for a further 35 days and analysed to examine MAA retention characteristics. Our findings are that krill acquired different MAAs from dietary algae depending on the light conditions under which the algae were grown. Specifically, krill fed algae grown under PAR-only had higher concentrations of porphyra-334 than starved krill. Conversely, krill fed algae grown under PAR with additional UVR had high body concentrations of mycosporine-glycine:valine. MAA concentrations in starved krill remained static throughout the experiment. However, long term starvation (35 days) caused levels of certain acquired MAAs to decline. From this we can infer that MAA concentrations in krill are dependent on the MAA content of phytoplankton, and therefore the algae’s response to UV exposure. This has implications for transfer of MAAs through marine trophic webs.},

	abstract = {During a recent period of increased influx of warm Atlantic water to the western coast of Svalbard, we have observed a northward expansion of boreal Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) into areas dominated by the native polar cod (Boreogadus saida). To determine the potential impact of new ecological interactions, we studied the diet of co-occurring juvenile gadoids in fjords, open water, and sea ice around Svalbard. We also reviewed the available literature on polar cod feeding in different habitats across the Arctic to determine whether region, habitat, or fish size may influence diet. Feeding by polar cod in the pelagic zone was size dependent, with small fish primarily consuming Calanus spp. and smaller copepods, with an increasing ration of Themisto spp. at larger sizes. In benthic habitats, diets were more varied and included considerably more unidentified material and sediment. Less than 40\% dietary overlap was detected among the three species when they were found together. Stable isotope analyses indicated these patterns were representative of longer-term assimilation. The low interspecific dietary overlap suggests little direct competition. Future increases in abundance and the high predation potential of the boreal taxa, however, may impact the persistence of polar cod on some Arctic shelves.},

	abstract = {An erratum has been published for this article in International Journal of Climatology 25 (8) 2005, 1147–1148. The Reference Antarctic Data for Environmental Research (READER) project data set of monthly mean Antarctic near-surface temperature, mean sea-level pressure (MSLP) and wind speed has been used to investigate trends in these quantities over the last 50 years for 19 stations with long records. Eleven of these had warming trends and seven had cooling trends in their annual data (one station had too little data to allow an annual trend to be computed), indicating the spatial complexity of change that has occurred across the Antarctic in recent decades. The Antarctic Peninsula has experienced a major warming over the last 50 years, with temperatures at Faraday/Vernadsky station having increased at a rate of 0.56 °C decade−1 over the year and 1.09 °C decade−1 during the winter; both figures are statistically significant at less than the 5\% level. Overlapping 30 year trends of annual mean temperatures indicate that, at all but two of the 10 coastal stations for which trends could be computed back to 1961, the warming trend was greater (or the cooling trend less) during the 1961–90 period compared with 1971–2000. All the continental stations for which MSLP data were available show negative trends in the annual mean pressures over the full length of their records, which we attribute to the trend in recent decades towards the Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM) being in its high-index state. Except for Halley, where the trends are constant, the MSLP trends for all stations on the Antarctic continent for 1971–2000 were more negative than for 1961–90. All but two of the coastal stations have recorded increasing mean wind speeds over recent decades, which is also consistent with the change in the nature of the SAM.

	volume = {80},
	abstract = {A tractable approach to understand the effects of climate change on Ecosystems is the focus on keystone species whose biology is so pervasive as to dictate ecosystem functioning. A critical aspect in the understanding of the effect of climate change on pelagic systems is the need to progress beyond correlative studies towards a mechanistic understanding. How exactly do changesoscillationstrends in the environment affect sensitive life cycle stages and thus dictate population size of key species, which in turn have a large impact on the environment? The Polar Regions represent one of the most rapidly warming areas on the globe. Therefore, a model polar organism to study and to understand the effect of climate change on the Southern Ocean ecosystem is Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). This organism plays a key role in the food web of the Southern Ocean both as grazer of a variety of pelagic invertebrates and algae and as prey for a wide range of Antarctic fish, birds and mammals. The progressing climate change might alter krills habitat in different ways (e.g. reduced sea ice coverage, changes in food quality and quantity, and a rise in sea water temperature). Long-term studies have already demonstrated that the krill population in the SW Atlantic decreased by about 80 \% over the last 30 years and that this decrease is associated with a decline in winter sea ice coverage. It is suggested that the recruitment success of krill is related to seasonal sea ice dynamic but the knowledge of the mechanisms, which link krill population size to environmental variability is lacking. Up to now, the adaptability of krill to their extreme changing environment in short terms due to seasonality (daylight duration, food availability, sea-ice cover) and in long terms due to climate change (increasing sea-water temperature, decline in sea-ice cover, food quantity and quality) is unknown in many cases. However, this knowledge is essential to understand the impact of the progres- sing global warming trend on the population size of krill and consequently on the Antarctic marine ecosystem.},

Quantitative estimates of recruitment are obtained from models of stock assessment and stock projection employing information supplied by FOCI. To generate its information, FOCI convenes specialists in marine biology, physical and fisheries oceanography, meteorology, and statistics to assemble and analyse relevant biological and physical time series with respect to recruitment and processes hypothesized to influence fish survival. Statistical methods encompass linear and nonlinear regression, stochastic simulation modelling, transfer function time series modelling, and tree-modelling regression. The current database consists of 31 years of data, and analyses have identified factors that affect ocean stratification and circulation during spring and summer of the fish's birth year as being important to recruitment. A conceptual model of the recruitment process serves as the framework for a recruitment forecast scheme. A stochastic mathematical simulation model of the conceptual model produces similarities between simulated and observed recruitment time series. FOCI has successfully forecast recruitment observed over the past several years.},

	abstract = {Proteins in the arthropod hemocyanin gene family are involved in major physiological processes, including aerobic respiration, the innate immune response, and molting. Members of this family, hemocyanin, cryptocyanin, and phenoloxidase, are multisubunit molecules that assemble into hexamers and higher aggregates. The hemocyanin hexamers show species-specific subunit heterogeneity. It is hypothesized that this subunit diversity is maintained as a mechanism of selection for functional diversity under changing developmental and environmental conditions. There is good evidence for a strong relationship between subunit composition and functional diversity in the hemocyanins. We have amplified, cloned, and sequenced the complete cDNAs of the 6 hemocyanin genes, 2 cryptocyanins, and 1 phenoloxidase of Cancer magister. Alignment of the amino acid sequences provides the first opportunity to assess in 1 species of brachyuran crustacean the similarities and differences among all the hemocyanin subunits and compare them with cryptocyanin and phenoloxidase. A phylogeny of sequences of crustacean members of the arthropod hemocyanin gene family is described. Construction of a cDNA library for C. magister microarray studies is in progress. The microarrays will be queried using transcriptional profiles from crabs sampled during developmental, molting, and physiological perturbations. The combination of genomics, proteomics, and gene-by-gene analyses will help us dissect how much a gene sequence in this hemocyanin family can vary while conserving function and which aspects of preservation of shape and structural flexibility are essential for functional stability. Integrating focused gene studies with global-expression profiling can eventually lead to the identification of functional networks at the level of the gene, the multisubunit molecule, and the whole organism},

Specialization to temperatures at or below 0 {\textless}latex{\textgreater}\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}textbackslashcirc\${\textless}/latex{\textgreater}C is associated with an inability to survive at temperatures above 3-8 {\textless}latex{\textgreater}\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}textbackslashcirc\${\textless}/latex{\textgreater}C. Polar fish synthesize various types of glycoproteins or peptides to lower the freezing point of most extracellular fluid compartments in a non-colligative manner. Antifreeze production is seasonal in boreal species and is often initiated by environmental cues other than low temperature, particularly short day lengths. Most of the adaptations that enable intertidal invertebrates to survive freezing are associated with their ability to withstand ariel exposure. Unique adaptations for freezing avoidance include the synthesis of low molecular mass ice-nucleating proteins that control and induce extracellular ice-formation. Marine poikilotherms also exhibit a range of capacity adaptations that increase the rate of some physiological processes so as to partially compensate for the effects of low temperature. However, the rate of embryonic development in a diverse range of marine organisms shows no evidence of temperature compensation. This results in a significant lengthening of the time from fertilization to hatching in polar, relative to temperate, species. Some aspects of the physiology of polar marine species, such as low metabolic and slow growth rates, probably result from a combination of low temperature and other factors such as the highly seasonal nature of food supplies. Although neuromuscular function shows a partial capacity adaptation in Antarctic fish, maximum swimming speeds are lower than for temperate and tropical species, particularly for early stages in the life history.},

	abstract = {Changes in the extent of Antarctic sea-ice are difficult to quantify for the pre-satellite era. The available direct data are sparse. A substantially larger set of proxy records based on whaling positions indicated a large shift in whaling positions between the 1930s to 1950s compared with whaling positions in the 1970s to mid 1980s. However, these findings have been questioned. Further analyses here using historic ice charts, direct sea-ice observations and whaling positions agree that a substantial southward shift in the ice-edge did occur. The analyses indicate the average change is around 1.89° to 2.80° of latitude with a reasonable mid-range estimate of 2.41°. Regional analyses show that the largest changes occurred in the South Atlantic, but change is also detected across the Indian Ocean to the Ross Sea; a 220° span of longitude. A recently published proposition that the shift in ice-edges is an artefact caused by bias in the satellite derived records is not supported.},

Over the period of starvation, the respiration rate of all three species followed the same pattern of an initial decrease followed by a more or less constant level. A similar pattern was observed for the ammonia excretion rate of S. elegans and A. clausi, whereas C. finmarchicus excretion appeared to oscillate between high and low levels of protein catabolism. Study of the biochemical changes showed that C. finmarchicus consumed primarily lipids, and at times proteins, to meet its energy requirement whereas S. elegans and A. clausi primarily used protein. Variations in the elemental composition as well as the O:N ratio confirmed that C. finmarchicus alternated between periods of protein-dominant catabolism and lipid-dominant catabolism during starvation. No similar change in catabolism was observed in the two other species. The results are discussed in terms of physiological mechanisms of resistance to starvation and were used to calculate the energy budget of S. elegans and C. finmarchicus during the period of total starvation. The significance of such budgets is discussed and some of the sources of error examined.},

	abstract = {The oxidative pentose phosphate pathway is a major source of reducing power and metabolic intermediates for biosynthetic processes. Some, if not all, of the enzymes of the pathway are found in both the cytosol and plastids, although the precise distribution of their activities varies. The apparent absence of sections of the pathway from the cytosol potentially complicates metabolism. These complications are partly offset, however, by exchange of intermediates between the cytosol and the plastids through the activities of a family of plastid phosphate translocators. Molecular analysis is confirming the widespread presence of multiple genes encoding each of the enzymes of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. Differential expression of these isozymes may ensure that the kinetic properties of the activity that catalyses a specific reaction match the metabolic requirements of a particular tissue. This hypothesis can be tested thanks to recent developments in the application of 13C-steady-state labelling strategies. These strategies make it possible to quantify flux through metabolic networks and to discriminate between pathways of carbohydrate oxidation in the cytosol and plastids.},

	abstract = {The Southern Ocean ecosystem is characterized by extreme seasonal changes in environmental factors such as day length, sea ice extent and food availability. The key species Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) has evolved metabolic and behavioural seasonal rhythms to cope with these seasonal changes. We investigate the switch between a physiological less active and active period for adult krill, a rhythm which seems to be controlled by internal biological clocks. These biological clocks can be synchronized by environmental triggers such as day length and food availability. They have evolved for particular environmental regimes to synchronize predictable seasonal environmental changes with important life cycle functions of the species. In a changing environment the time when krill is metabolically active and the time of peak food availability may not overlap if krill's seasonal activity is solely determined by photoperiod (day length). This is especially true for the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean where the spatio-temporal ice cover dynamics are changing substantially with rising average temperatures. We developed an individual-based model for krill to explore the impact of photoperiod and food availability on the growth and demographics of krill. We simulated dynamics of local krill populations (with no movement of krill assumed) along a south-north gradient for different triggers of metabolic activity and different levels of food availability below the ice. We also observed the fate of larval krill which cannot switch to low metabolism and therefore are likely to overwinter under ice. Krill could only occupy the southern end of the gradient, where algae bloom only lasts for a short time, when alternative food supply under the ice was high and metabolic activity was triggered by photoperiod. The northern distribution was limited by lack of overwintering habitat for krill larvae due to short duration of sea ice cover even for high food content under the ice. The variability of the krill's length-frequency distributions varied for different triggers of metabolic activity, but did not depend on the sea ice extent. Our findings suggest a southward shift of krill populations due to reduction in the spatial sea ice extent, which is consistent with field observations. Overall, our results highlight the importance of the explicit consideration of spatio-temporal sea ice dynamics especially for larval krill together with temporal synchronization through internal clocks, triggered by environmental factors (photoperiod and food) in adult krill for the population modelling of krill.},

	abstract = {The native habitats of the ctenophore, Mnemiopsis, are temperate to subtropical estuaries along the Atlantic coast of North and South America, where it is found in an extremely wide range of environmental conditions (winter low and summer high temperatures of 2 and 32 °C, respectively, and salinities of {\textless}2–38). In the early 1980s, it was accidentally introduced to the Black Sea, where it flourished and expanded into the Azov, Marmara, Mediterranean and Caspian Seas. We compile data showing that Mnemiopsis has high potentials of growth, reproduction and feeding that enable this species to be a predominant zooplanktivore in a wide variety of habitats; review the population distributions and dynamics of Mnemiopsis in U.S. waters and in the Black Sea region; and examine the effects of temperature and salinity, zooplankton availability and predator abundance on Mnemiopsis population size in both regions, and the effects of Mnemiopsis on zooplankton, ichthyoplankton and fish populations, focusing on Chesapeake Bay and the Black Sea. In both regions, Mnemiopsis populations are restricted by low winter temperatures ({\textless}2 °C). In native habitats, predators of Mnemiopsis often limit their populations, and zooplanktivorous fish are abundant and may compete with the ctenophores for food. By contrast, in the Black Sea region, no obvious predators of Mnemiopsis were present during the decade following introduction when the ctenophore populations flourished. Additionally, zooplanktivorous fish populations had been severely reduced by over fishing prior to the ctenophore outbreak. Thus, small populations of potential predators and competitors for food enabled Mnemiopsis populations to swell in the new habitats. In Chesapeake Bay, Mnemiopsis consumes substantial proportions of zooplankton daily, but may only noticeably reduce zooplankton populations when predators of Mnemiopsis are uncommon. Mnemiopsis also is an important predator of fish eggs in both locations. In the Black Sea, reductions in zooplankton, ichthyoplankton and zooplanktivorous fish populations have been attributed to Mnemiopsis. We conclude that the enormous impact of Mnemiopsis on the Black Sea ecosystem occurred because of the shortage of predators and competitors in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The appearance of the ctenophore, Beroe ovata, may promote the recovery of the Black Sea ecosystem from the effects of the Mnemiopsis invasion.},

Two alternative hypotheses addressing the function of cytosine methylation in invertebrates are evaluated: (1) cytosine methylation is an ancient regulatory mechanism which was lost in species with low rates of cell turnover, and (2) cytosine methylation is primarily a defense mechanism against genomic parasites and is expected to be present in all species with large genomes.

	abstract = {The Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) has been overexploited in the North Sea since the late 1960s and great concern has been expressed about the decline in cod biomass and recruitment. Here we show that, in addition to the effects of overfishing, fluctuations in plankton have resulted in long-term changes in cod recruitment in the North Sea (bottom-up control). Survival of larval cod is shown to depend on three key biological parameters of their prey: the mean size of prey, seasonal timing and abundance. We suggest a mechanism, involving the match/mismatch hypothesis, by which variability in temperature affects larval cod survival and conclude that rising temperature since the mid-1980s has modified the plankton ecosystem in a way that reduces the survival of young cod.},

	abstract = {Marine ecosystems of the Southern Ocean are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification1 . Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba; hereafter krill) is the key pelagic species of the region and its largest fishery resource2 . There is therefore concern about the combined effects of climate change, ocean acidification and an expanding fishery on krill and ultimately, their dependent predatorswhales, seals and penguins3,4 . However, little is known about the sensitivity of krill to ocean acidification. Juvenile and adult krill are already exposed to variable seawater carbonate chemistry because they occupy a range of habitats and migrate both vertically and horizontally on a daily and seasonal basis5 . Moreover, krill eggs sink from the surface to hatch at 700-1,000 m (ref. 6), where the carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2 ) in sea water is already greater than it is in the atmosphere7 . Krill eggs sink passively and so cannot avoid these conditions. Here we describe the sensitivity of krill egg hatch rates to increased CO2 , and present a circumpolar risk map of krill hatching success under projected pCO2 levels. We find that important krill habitats of the Weddell Sea and the Haakon VII Sea to the east are likely to become high-risk areas for krill recruitment within a century. Furthermore, unless CO2 emissions are mitigated, the Southern Ocean krill population could collapse by 2300 with dire consequences for the entire ecosystem.},

In insects and vertebrates, the genes that encode these feedback regulators are remarkably well conserved and function to control not 1 but 2 feedback loops. These feedback loops control rhythmic transcription in opposite phases of the circadian cycle, yet they are interlocked because they share a number of components. In this review, the author will compare transcriptional regulatory mechanisms within the Drosophila and mammalian feedback loops and outline remaining questions concerning transcriptional regulation within and downstream of these feedback loops.},

	abstract = {We investigated influences of the thermal environment on patterns of body temperature (Tb), activity, and use of burrows during the active season in a population of free-living arctic ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii). Arctic ground squirrels normally exhibited a daily 5°C range in Tb, and had higher Tb when above ground than when in burrows (P {\textless} 0.0001). This difference decreased as standard operative temperature (Tes; an index of environmental heat load) increased. Ground squirrels entered burrows more frequently on warmer compared to average or cooler days and when Tb exceeded 39°C. On cool days with heavy precipitation, ground squirrels remained almost exclusively below ground, and peaks in Tb were associated with brief aboveground forays. Time on the surface was maximal (about 80\% between 0500 and 2200 h) at Tes = 17–33°C and decreased proportionately with decreasing Tes from 17°C to —2°C. Forty-six percent of variation in timing of presence above ground could be explained by a series of thermal and nonthermal variables related to environmental heat transfer. This suggests that diurnal activity patterns in this arctic environment with 24-h daylight result from a strategy that minimizes thermoregulatory costs.},

Given their significant contribution to the biomass of the Southern Ocean, it is vitally important to gain a better understanding of their physiology and, in particular, anticipate their responses to climate change effects in the warming seas around Antarctica.Methodology/Principal FindingsIllumina sequencing was used to produce a transcriptome of the ice krill. Analysis of the assembled contigs via two different methods, produced 36 new pre-pro-peptides, coding for 61 neuropeptides or peptide hormones belonging to the following families: Allatostatins (A, B et C), Bursicon (α and β), Crustacean Hyperglycemic Hormones (CHH and MIH/VIHs), Crustacean Cardioactive Peptide (CCAP), Corazonin, Diuretic Hormones (DH), the Eclosion Hormone (EH), Neuroparsin, Neuropeptide F (NPF), small Neuropeptide F (sNPF), Pigment Dispersing Hormone (PDH), Red Pigment Concentrating Hormone (RPCH) and finally Tachykinin. LC/MS/MS proteomics was also carried out on eyestalk extracts, which are the major site of neuropeptide synthesis in decapod crustaceans. Results confirmed the presence of six neuropeptides and six precursor-related peptides previously identified in the transcriptome analyses.ConclusionsThis study represents the first comprehensive analysis of neuropeptide hormones in a Eucarida non-decapod Malacostraca, several of which are described for the first time in a non-decapod crustacean. Additionally, there is a potential expansion of PDH and Neuropeptide F family members, which may reflect certain life history traits such as circadian rhythms associated with diurnal migrations and also the confirmation via mass spectrometry of several novel pre-pro-peptides, of unknown function. Knowledge of these essential hormones provides a vital framework for understanding the physiological response of this key Southern Ocean species to climate change and provides a valuable resource for studies into the molecular phylogeny of these organisms and the evolution of neuropeptide hormones.},

	abstract = {Two beta-pigment-dispersing hormone (beta-PDH) isoforms have been identified in several decapod crustaceans, including the crab Cancer productus, but whether these peptides serve common or distinct physiological roles remains to be elucidated. Here we show that the distribution of beta-PDH-like immunoreactivity in the nervous system of C. productus is similar to that found in other brachyurans, suggesting roles as both a circulating hormone and a locally released transmitter for members of this peptide family. cDNAs encoding NSELINSILGLPKVMNDAamide (authentic beta-PDH; here termed Canpr-beta-PDH I) or NSELINSLLGLSRLMNEAamide [corrected](Canpr-beta-PDH II) were cloned. Double in situ hybridization revealed that these two beta-PDH isoforms are differentially distributed within the eyestalk. For example, in most neurons between the medulla interna (MI) and the medulla terminalis (MT), both isoforms appear present; however, in some neurons in this region, mRNA for only one or the other isoform was detected. Likewise, only prepro-beta-pdh I mRNA was detected in the somata of the lamina ganglionaris (LG) and in the brain. By direct tissue mass spectrometry, only Canpr-beta-PDH II was detected in the neurosecretory sinus gland (SG), whereas Canpr-beta-PDH I was found in all other parts of the eyestalk. Collectively, these data suggest distinct functions for each of the C. productus beta-PDHs; Canpr-beta-PDH II appears to be a neurohormone in the SG, whereas Canpr-beta-PDH I may function as a local transmitter/modulator. Our data support the hypothesis that duplication and subsequent mutation of a common neuropeptide gene may underlie the evolution of two differentially distributed transcripts that serve distinct physiological roles.},

The identified hormones include: an octapeptide RPCH (red pigment-concentrating hormone) and several forms of octadecapeptide PDH (pigment-dispersing hormone: α-PDH, β-PDH). RPCH-related peptides (AKHs, adipokinetic hormones) and PDH-related peptides (PDFs, pigment-dispersing factors) occur in insects, and are recognized as members of AKH/RPCH and PDH/PDF peptide families. The domain for mature peptide is located between the signal peptide and precursor-related peptide in AKH/RPCH precursors, and at the C-terminal end in the PDH/PDF precursors. The precursor-related (associated) peptides in RPCH and PDH precursors in Crustacea show little or no similarity to corresponding domains of AKH and PDF precursors in insects. Although the functions of precursor-related peptides are unknown, the mature peptides are shown to serve diverse functions. RPCH's actions in crustaceans include: pigment concentration in one or more types of chromatophores, dark-adaptational screening pigment movement in distal eye pigment cells, increase of retinal sensitivity, and neuromodulation. The related AKHs largely influence metabolism in insects, although they serve additional functions. PDHs trigger pigment dispersion in chromatophores and induce light-adaptational screening pigment movements in extraretinular eye pigment cells. The related PDFs appear to serve as a transmitter of circadian signals in the regulation of biological rhythms in insects. Evolutionary relationships among the PDH/PDF peptides and directions for future research are discussed.},

	abstract = {Apart from providing an up-to-date review of the literature, considerable emphasis was placed in this article on the historical development of the field of “crustacean eyestalk hormones”. A role of the neurosecretory eyestalk structures of crustaceans in endocrine regulation was recognized about 80 years ago, but it took another half a century until the first peptide hormones were identified. Following the identification of crustacean hyperglycaemic hormone (CHH) and moult-inhibiting hormone (MIH), a large number of homologous peptides have been identified to this date. They comprise a family of multifunctional peptides which can be divided, according to sequences and precursor structure, into two subfamilies, type-I and -II. Recent results on peptide sequences, structure of genes and precursors are described here. The best studied biological activities include metabolic control, moulting, gonad maturation, ionic and osmotic regulation and methyl farnesoate synthesis in mandibular glands. Accordingly, the names CHH, MIH, and GIH/VIH (gonad/vitellogenesis-inhibiting hormone), MOIH (mandibular organ-inhibiting hormone) were coined. The identification of ITP (ion transport peptide) in insects showed, for the first time, that CHH-family peptides are not restricted to crustaceans, and data mining has recently inferred their occurrence in other ecdysozoan clades as well. The long-held tenet of exclusive association with the eyestalk X-organ-sinus gland tract has been challenged by the finding of several extra nervous system sites of expression of CHH-family peptides. Concerning mode of action and the question of target tissues, second messenger mechanisms are discussed, as well as binding sites and receptors. Future challenges are highlighted.},

Many RNA-seq studies have used insufficient biological replicates, resulting in low statistical power and inefficient use of sequencing resources., Results: We show the explicit trade-off between more biological replicates and deeper sequencing in increasing power to detect differentially expressed (DE) genes. In the human cell line MCF7, adding more sequencing depth after 10 M reads gives diminishing returns on power to detect DE genes, whereas adding biological replicates improves power significantly regardless of sequencing depth. We also propose a cost-effectiveness metric for guiding the design of large-scale RNA-seq DE studies. Our analysis showed that sequencing less reads and performing more biological replication is an effective strategy to increase power and accuracy in large-scale differential expression RNA-seq studies, and provided new insights into efficient experiment design of RNA-seq studies., Availability and implementation: The code used in this paper is provided on: http://home.uchicago.edu/∼jiezhou/replication/.

In consequence, it is necessary to study how these alterations can affect the habitat and population dynamics of key organisms. Here we used a video plankton recorder (VPR) to investigate the effect of climate-induced habitat changes on the copepod Pseudocalanus acuspes, a key species in the Baltic Sea. The VPR allowed the observation of reproducing copepod females, identified by attached egg sacs, usually lost during traditional net sampling. We compared the small-scale distribution of our target species during non-inflow and inflow periods. Our study showed a large increase in the availability of suitable habitat after the inflow event due to improved oxygen and salinity conditions. Furthermore, increased copepod abundance and a deeper and wider vertical distribution was apparent. Applying a new approach to estimate in situ egg production rates from VPR-derived images revealed no changes. However, we observed increased offspring survival with improved hydrographic conditions pointing toward the importance of salinity and oxygen for the population dynamics of Baltic P. acuspes. Our observations illustrate the strong impact that climate change can have on the habitat of key marine ecosystem species, important for overall ecosystem dynamics.},

Expression levels of “classical” reference genes can differ, however, across experimental conditions. Although quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) has been used extensively to decipher gene function in the sweetpotato whitefly Bemisia tabaci, a world-wide pest in many agricultural systems, the stability of its reference genes has rarely been validated.ResultsIn this study, 15 candidate reference genes from B. tabaci were evaluated using two Excel-based algorithms geNorm and Normfinder under a diverse set of biotic and abiotic conditions. At least two reference genes were selected to normalize gene expressions in B. tabaci under experimental conditions. Specifically, for biotic conditions including host plant, acquisition of a plant virus, developmental stage, tissue (body region of the adult), and whitefly biotype, ribosomal protein L29 was the most stable reference gene. In contrast, the expression of elongation factor 1 alpha, peptidylprolyl isomerase A, NADH dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit A and heat shock protein 40 were consistently stable across various abiotic conditions including photoperiod, temperature, and insecticide susceptibility.ConclusionOur finding is the first step toward establishing a standardized quantitative real-time PCR procedure following the MIQE (Minimum Information for publication of Quantitative real time PCR Experiments) guideline in an agriculturally important insect pest, and provides a solid foundation for future RNA interference based functional study in B. tabaci.},

In marine ecosystems, planktonic copepods play a significant role as food resources in the food web and sensitively respond to environmental changes. The copepod Paracylopina nana is one of the planktonic brackish water copepods and considered as a promising model species in ecotoxicology. We sequenced the whole transcriptome of P. nana using RNA-seq technology. De novo sequence assembly by Trinity integrated with TransDecoder produced 67,179 contigs including putative alternative spliced variants. A total of 12,474 genes were identified based on BLAST analysis, and gene sequences were most similar to the sequences of the branchiopod Daphnia. Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analysis showed that most transcripts annotated were involved in pathways of various metabolisms, immune system, signal transduction, and translation. Considering numbers of sequences and enzymes involved in the pathways, particularly attention was paid to genes potentially involved in xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism. With regard to xenobiotics metabolism, various xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes such as oxidases, dehydrogenases, and transferases were obtained from the annotated transcripts. The whole transcriptome analysis of P. nana provides valuable resources for future studies of xenobiotics-related metabolism in this marine copepod species.},

Oxygen consumption by the overwintering and active spring/summer population of animals was determined at temperatures close to in situ temperatures. Laboratory measurements of oxygen consumption were also made at standardized temperatures (0°C, 5°C, 7°C and 12.5°C) to determine the sensitivity of animals to temperature change in the different seasons. Rates of oxygen consumption were very low (7–30 μmol O2 gC−1 h−1) at in situ temperatures during the winter and early spring and significantly higher (105–219 μmol O2 gC−1 h−1) for the active surface population in May and June. Animals collected from the overwintering population showed no significant response to changes in temperature. Due to the low respiration rates, the calculated rate of decrease in carbon content in diapausing copepodite stage CV was very low (approximately 0.250 μgC day−1). The respiration rates were used to construct a model to estimate survival of the animals with an initial carbon content equivalent to that expected of animals in October. The results showed that in order to survive during winter and have enough energy for moulting and migration to the surface in the spring, these animals have to live at temperatures close to 0°C and be in a diapause state.},

However, model studies of past climate and geological records suggest that ENSO variability has existed on Earth as far back as in the Eocene and the Miocene. In the early-to-middle Miocene, climate was not only warmer than today, but oceanic gateways such as the Indonesian Passage and the Central American Seaway established deep connections between the main ocean basins. Here, we analyse the effect of increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases and open tropical gateways on the amplitude, period and pattern of ENSO variability using results of fully coupled climate model simulations. While our model shows only small changes in ENSO variability under increased greenhouse gas levels, it suggests a significantly stronger and less frequent ENSO due to altered oceanic gateways. In particular, a deeper and more open Indonesian Passage does not prevent a Western Pacific warm pool from developing, but it allows the warm pool to shift into the Indian Ocean.},

Annually laminated oil shales from the maar lake of Messel (Germany) provide high-resolution sedimentological and paleoenvironmental data of a time interval of ∼600 k.y. during the Eocene greenhouse phase. Individual laminae consist of a light spring and summer algal layer (Tetraedron minimum layer) and a dark winter layer composed of terrigenous background sediment. Four sections were selected from the core of the Messel 2001 well in order to count varves and to measure total varve thickness and the thickess of light and dark laminae. Spectral analyses were done in order to detect possible cyclic fluctuations in varve thickness. Fluctuations are significant in the quasi-biennial (2.1–2.5 yr) and low-frequency band (2.8–3.5 yr, 4.9–5.6 yr), thus showing that algal growth as well as the background sedimentation were controlled by ENSO effects at least over a time interval of 600 k.y. This confirms the existence of a previously postulated robust Eocene ENSO. Significant peaks within a quasi-decadal (10–11 yr), interdecadal (17–26 yr), and multidecadal band (∼52 yr, ∼82 yr) show either the enduring influence of more or less cyclic instabilities or the influence of solar cycles.},

	abstract = {The seasonal changes in the respiration of Calanus are considerable and are, on the whole, related to size and therefore to weight. Length alone is not enough to account for the differences since ripe females, although the same length as unripe, have a markedly higher respiration. In addition, by taking samples of large and of small Calanus of a single stage, it was shown that the difference in respiration was small. Neither is weight by itself enough to account for the difference between groups. Stage V Calanus are, for a given length, heavier even than ripe females and yet their oxygen utilization is low. In this instance, however, an important part of the weight consists of fat which is a food reserve and not actively metabolizing. The difference of weight between ripe and unripe females is not known, but ripe females must be heavier and this will account for their higher oxygen consumption.Although the oxygen and therefore the food required during the spring months is high, at that time the phytoplankton is at its maximum and is probably sufficient to fulfil all needs. Egg-laying depends on the food supply and it is then that Calanus starts breeding. In winter, on the other hand, the Calanus is present as Stage V and oxygen consumption is little more than half what earlier figures suggested. No ‘hibernation’ seems to take place but the population is living in an economical way for Stage V use little oxygen, live in deep water and do not undertake diurnal vertical migration.At 10° C ripe female Calanus will require daily from 3·9–7·2\% of their body weight as dry matter in summer and from 2·8–6·7\% in winter. Stage V will require 2·3–3·1\% in summer and 1·4–3·3\% in winter. The higher values are for carbohydrate and the lower for fat.It is difficult to believe that Calanus in winter will be able to find enough food by filtration alone. The fact that in the winter months it depends more on predation may account for its survival.},

	abstract = {Calanus helgolandicus is a key copepod of the NE Atlantic and fringing shelves, with a distribution that is expanding northwards with oceanic warming. The Plymouth L4 site has warmed over the past 25-years, and experiences large variations in the timing and availability of food for C. helgolandicus. Here we examine the degree to which these changes translate into variation in reproductive output and subsequently C. helgolandicus population size. Egg production rates (eggs female-1 day-1) were maximal in the spring to early-summer period of diatom blooms and high ciliate abundance, rather than during the equally large autumn blooms of autotrophic dinoflagellates. Egg hatch success was lower in spring however, with a greater proportion of naupliar deformities then also. Both the timing and the mean summer abundance of C. helgolandicus (CI-CVI) reflected those of spring total reproductive output. However this relationship was driven by inter-annual variability in female abundance and not that of egg production per female, which ranged only two-fold. Winter abundance of C. helgolandicus at L4 was much more variable than abundance in other seasons, and reflected conditions from the previous growing season. However, these low winter abundances had no clear carry-over signal to the following season’s population size. Overall, the C. helgolandicus population appears to be surprisingly resilient at this dynamic, inshore site, showing no long-term phenology shift and only a four-fold variation in mean abundance between years. This dampening effect may reflect a series of mortality sources, associated with the timing of stratification in the early part of the season, likely affecting egg sinking and loss, plus intense, density-dependent mortality of early stages in mid-summer likely through predation.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY1. Experiments have been done to determine the oxygen utilisation by male, female and Stage V Calanus under different environmental conditions.2. An initial fall in the respiration of adult Calanus was observed during the first few hours after capture. Stage V do not show this clearly. It is found more often in winter than in summer.3. The lethal temperature varies from 24° C. in winter to 26° C. in summer. Stage V Calanus are more resistant to high temperatures than adults.4. Respiration rises with increase of temperature from 0° C. to 20° C. The increase does not follow van't Hoff's law. The oxygen consumption of males and females is about the same, while that of Stage V is lower. Above 20° C. there is a harmful effect.5. Within the limits studied (pH 7.4–pH 8.5) change in hydrogen-ion concentration has no effect on respiration.6. Calanus are unaffected by an increase in the oxygen content of the water, but are sensitive to low oxygen tensions. Below a concentration of about 3 ml. per litre the respiration decreases. At concentrations between 1 and 2 ml. per litre they are killed. They are more resistant at 5° C. than at 15° C. and Stage V are more resistant than adults at both these temperatures.7. Calanus can become acclimatised to salinities as low as 35–40\% seawater (S=12‰–13.6‰), but their respiration is lowered at a salinity of 50\%.8. Light has a striking effect on Calanus. It may increase the respiration by 100\% or more. This effect can be detected also in the sea, but not below 5 metres. Continuous exposure to light is harmful.9. The bearing of these results on the distribution of Calanus is discussed.10. From the amount of oxygen used in respiration, calculations of the food required are made and these are compared with the results given by Putter for Calanus and other copepods.},

	abstract = {In a warming climate, differential shifts in the seasonal timing of predators and prey have been suggested to lead to trophic “mismatches” that decouple primary, secondary and tertiary production. We tested this hypothesis using a 25-year time-series of weekly sampling at the Plymouth L4 site, comparing 57 plankton taxa spanning 4 trophic levels. During warm years, there was a weak tendency for earlier timings of spring taxa and later timings of autumn taxa. While this is in line with many previous findings, numerous exceptions existed and only a few taxa (e.g. Gyrodinium spp., Pseudocalanus elongatus, and Acartia clausi) showed consistent, strong evidence for temperature-related timing shifts, revealed by all 4 of the timing indices that we used. Also, the calculated offsets in timing (i.e. “mismatches”) between predator and prey were no greater in extreme warm or cold years than during more average years. Further, the magnitude of these offsets had no effect on the “success” of the predator, in terms of their annual mean abundance or egg production rates. Instead numerous other factors override, including: inter-annual variability in food quantity, high food baseline levels, turnover rates and prolonged seasonal availability, allowing extended periods of production. Furthermore many taxa, notably meroplankton, increased well before the spring bloom. While theoretically a chronic mismatch, this likely reflects trade-offs for example in predation avoidance. Various gelatinous taxa (Phaeocystis, Noctiluca, ctenophores, appendicularians, medusae) may have reduced these predation constraints, with variable, explosive population outbursts likely responding to improved conditions. The match-mismatch hypothesis may apply for highly seasonal, pulsed systems or specialist feeders, but we suggest that the concept is being over-extended to other marine systems where multiple factors compensate.},

Using the widespread model species Arabidopsis thaliana, we explore how variation in different genetic pathways can be linked to phenology and life-history variation across geographical regions and seasons. We show that the expression of phenological traits including flowering depends critically on the growth season, and we outline an integrated life-history approach to phenology in which the timing of later life-history events can be contingent on the environmental cues regulating earlier life stages. As flowering time in many plants is determined by the integration of multiple environmentally sensitive gene pathways, the novel combinations of important seasonal cues in projected future climates will alter how phenology responds to variation in the flowering time gene network with important consequences for plant life history. We discuss how phenology models in other systems—both natural and agricultural—could employ a similar framework to explore the potential contribution of genetic variation to the physiological integration of cues determining phenology.},

Using ITS1 analysis, cyclical changes in genetic composition were detected. Our results give clear indications concerning the segregation of the rock pool population and a lack of gene flow among outside populations. A network analysis shows the presence of several shared dominant haplotypes and also singletons differing by one mutation point. Fst analyses indicate that the main changes occur in autumn and winter. The few analogies of ITS1 sequences with nearby populations may indicate that new migrants must re-colonise the pools from surrounding rock crevices in the intertidal habitat where they may have found a refuge after bad weather conditions.},

The abundant species in the Southern North Sea, Temora longicornis, cannot accumulate extensive energy stores to buffer longer periods of food paucity. These copepods react immediately to dietary changes, and therefore, recent trophic conditions must strongly influence their metabolic and functional responses. To elucidate the implications of feeding history, we collected two cohorts of T. longicornis females, which were characterized by different feeding histories and consequently different physiological backgrounds. In the North Sea in April 2005, females fed at a higher trophic level than in May, were poor in lipids, showed low proteinase activity and produced 41 eggs female− 1 d− 1. In May, females were significantly smaller than in April, contained more lipids, had a higher proteinase activity, and produced 26 eggs female− 1 d− 1. In the laboratory, females from each group were fed with either autotrophic diatoms or heterotrophic dinoflagellates for 3 days. Irrespective of different initial conditions, all T. longicornis females incorporated diet-specific fatty acids within 24 h. Also in both experiments and each dietary treatment, egg production increased after 24 h, indicating that females were food-limited in situ in April and in May. Responses differed, however, with regard to lipid accumulation and enzyme activities. Total lipid contents increased significantly in females during Experiment I (April), but not during Experiment II (May), despite higher algal lipid levels during Experiment II. Proteolytic activity increased during Experiment I, but decreased during Experiment II. These deviating responses of T. longicornis females to food conditions suggest that detailed knowledge about the initial physiological state of specimens is required, when investigating adaptive mechanisms and metabolic performances of copepods by means of experiments.},

	abstract = {Oceanographic surveys were conducted in Roseway Basin, western Scotian Shelf, during late-summer from 2007 through 2009 to measure the magnitude of interannual variation in the spatial distribution of diapausing copepods Calanus finmarchicus and C. hyperboreus and associated water mass characteristics. Calanus spp. abundance, energy density and hydrography were measured at depths \&gt; 50m along transects using a Towed Underwater Biological Sampling System equipped with an Optical Plankton Counter (OPC) and a conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sensor, as well as at fixed stations using a Biological Net and Environmental Sampling System equipped with nets, OPC and CTD. Water mass density and in some cases salinity explained variation in the deep copepod layer across both time and space, whereas temperature did not. Water mass density, copepod energy density and thickness of the copepod layer were statistically lower during 2008 than 2007 or 2009. The copepod layer was absent from the western Basin margin during 2008 where low density continental water resided that year, whereas during 2007 and 2009 higher density continental slope water and copepods were each present along the western margin. Our results suggest that water mass density is an important characteristic defining the spatial and interannual ecology of the deep copepod layer in Roseway Basin. The 26 σt isopycnal may be a lower density limit to diapausing Calanus spp. habitat on continental shelves with shallow bathymetry, that helps the animals maintain neutral buoyancy during diapause.},

An understanding of the molecular mechanisms of diapause regulation, insecticide resistance, and other physiological processes is helpful for developing new management strategies for this beetle. However, the lack of genomic information and valid reference genes limits knowledge on the molecular bases of these physiological processes in this species. Results Using Illumina sequencing, we obtained more than 57 million sequence reads derived from C. bowringi, which were assembled into 39,390 unique sequences. A Clusters of Orthologous Groups classification was obtained for 9,048 of these sequences, covering 25 categories, and 16,951 were assigned to 255 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. Eleven candidate reference gene sequences from the transcriptome were then identified through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Among these candidate genes, EF1α, ACT1, and RPL19 proved to be the most stable reference genes for different reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction experiments in C. bowringi. Conversely, aTUB and GAPDH were the least stable reference genes. Conclusion The abundant putative C. bowringi transcript sequences reported enrich the genomic resources of this beetle. Importantly, the larger number of gene sequences and valid reference genes provide a valuable platform for future gene expression studies, especially with regard to exploring the molecular mechanisms of different physiological processes in this species.},

Flux capacities are in large excess over phys-iological f lux rates in low-f lux muscles, resulting in low fractional velocities (\%Vmax 5 vyVmax 3 100) in vivo.In high-f lux muscles, close matches between f lux capacities and f lux rates (resulting in fractional velocities approaching 100\% in vivo) are observed. These empirical observations are rec-onciled with current concepts concerning enzyme function and regulation. We suggest that in high-f lux muscles, close matches between enzymatic f lux capacities and metabolic f lux rates (i.e., the lack of excess capacities) may result from space constraints in the sarcoplasm.},

	abstract = {Much research in comparative physiology is now performed using 'omics' tools and many results are interpreted in terms of the effects of changes in gene expression on energy metabolism. However, 'metabolism' is a complex phenomenon that spans multiple levels of biological organization. In addition rates and directions of flux change dynamically under various physiological circumstances. Within cells, message level cannot be equated with protein level because multiple mechanisms are at play in the 'regulatory hierarchy' from gene to mRNA to enzyme protein. This results in many documented instances wherein change in mRNA levels and change in enzyme levels are unrelated. It is also known from metabolic control analysis that the influence of single steps in pathways on flux is often small. Flux is a system property and its control tends to be distributed among multiple steps. Consequently, change in enzyme levels cannot be equated with change in flux. Approaches developed by Hans Westerhoff and colleagues, called 'hierarchical regulation analysis', allow quantitative determination of the extent to which 'hierarchical regulation', involving change in enzyme level, and 'metabolic regulation', involving the modulation of the activity of preexisting enzyme, regulate flux. We outline these approaches and provide examples to show their applicability to problems of interest to comparative physiologists},

Very little is known about molecular regulation of hormone metabolism, moulting and reproduction in copepods. To investigate these processes, we sampled adult male and female copepods (females at three distinct reproductive stages) and copepodites stage five (CV) from the culture at SINTEF/NTNU Sealab. Copepods were individually photographed, analyzed biometrically (body size, length and lipid storage size) and for ecdysteroid concentrations. In addition, we analyzed copepods for gene expression of three putative cytochrome P450 enzymes possibly involved in ecdysteroid regulation: CYP301A1, CYP305A1 and CYP330A1. The CV group exhibited the highest ecdysteroid concentrations and the largest lipid storage size, and a significant positive correlation was found between these parameters. Also, two of the P450 enzymes (CYP305A1 and CYP330A1) were more highly expressed at CV than at the adult stage, suggesting that these P450 enzymes are involved in ecdysteroid synthesis and lipid storage regulation. The expression of CYP330A1 was higher in newly moulted females than in females that had produced eggs. In addition, we observed that ecdysteroid concentrations were higher in females with large egg sacs, suggesting that ecdysteroids may be involved in egg maturation and reproduction. The CYP301A1 was more highly expressed in males and post-spawning females, and may be involved in ecdysteroid degradation since these groups also exhibited the lowest ecdysteroid concentrations.},

Animals can remodel their physiology to compensate for the eects of temperature variation, and this physiological plasticity, or acclimation, can confer resilience to climate change1,2 . The current lack of a comprehensive analysis of the capacity for physiological plasticity across taxonomic groups and geographic regions, however, constrains predictions of the impacts of climate change. Here, we assembled the largest database to date to establish the current state of knowledge of physiological plasticity in ectothermic animals. We show that acclimation decreases the sensitivity to temperature and climate change of freshwater and marine animals, but less so in terrestrial animals. Animals from more stable environments have greater capacity for acclimation, and there is a significant trend showing that the capacity for thermal acclimation increases with decreasing latitude. Despite the capacity for acclimation, climate change over the past 20 years has already resulted in increased physiological rates of up to 20\%, and we predict further future increases under climate change. The generality of these predictions is limited, however, because much of the world is drastically undersampled in the literature, and these undersampled regions are the areas of greatest need for future research eorts.},

We studied the timing of reproductive diapause and its long-term effects on the cold tolerance of Drosophila montana, D. littoralis and D. ezoana females in seasonally varying environmental conditions. At the same time we traced expression levels of 219 genes in D. montana using a custom-made microarray. We show that the seasonal switch to reproductive diapause occurs over a short time period, and that overwintering in reproductive diapause has long-lasting effects on cold tolerance. Some genes, such as Hsc70, Jon25Bi and period, were upregulated throughout the diapause, while others, including regucalcin, couch potato and Thor, were upregulated only at its specific phases. Some of the expression patterns induced during the sensitive stage, when the females either enter diapause or not, remained induced regardless of the later conditions. qPCR analyses confirmed the findings of the microarray analysis in D. montana and revealed similar gene expression changes in D. littoralis and D. ezoana. The present study helps to achieve a better understanding of the genetic regulation of diapause and of the plasticity of seasonal responses in general.},

	abstract = {A compilation of more than 30 studies shows that adult Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) may frequent benthic habitats year-round, in shelf as well as oceanic waters and throughout their circumpolar range. Net and acoustic data from the Scotia Sea show that in summer 2-20\% of the population reside at depths between 200 and 2000 m, and that large aggregations can form above the seabed. Local differences in the vertical distribution of krill indicate that reduced feeding success in surface waters, either due to predator encounter or food shortage, might initiate such deep migrations and results in benthic feeding. Fatty acid and microscopic analyses of stomach content confirm two different foraging habitats for Antarctic krill: the upper ocean, where fresh phytoplankton is the main food source, and deeper water or the seabed, where detritus and copepods are consumed. Krill caught in upper waters retain signals of benthic feeding, suggesting frequent and dynamic exchange between surface and seabed. Krill contained up to 260 nmol iron per stomach when returning from seabed feeding. About 5\% of this iron is labile, i.e., potentially available to phytoplankton. Due to their large biomass, frequent benthic feeding, and acidic digestion of particulate iron, krill might facilitate an input of new iron to Southern Ocean surface waters. Deep migrations and foraging at the seabed are significant parts of krill ecology, and the vertical fluxes involved in this behavior are important for the coupling of benthic and pelagic food webs and their elemental repositories.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.pocean.2015.07.011},
	abstract = {This review paper integrates the current knowledge, based on available literature, on the physical and biological conditions of the Amerasian and Eurasian basins (AB, EB) of the deep Arctic Ocean (AO) in a comparative fashion. The present day (Holocene) AO is a mediterranean sea that is roughly half continental shelf and half basin and ridge complex. Even more recently it is roughly two thirds seasonally and one third perennially ice-covered, thus now exposing a portion of basin waters to sunlight and wind. Basin boundaries and submarine ridges steer circulation pathways in overlying waters and limit free exchange in deeper waters. The AO is made integral to the global ocean by the Northern Hemisphere Thermohaline Circulation (NHTC) which drives Pacific-origin water (PW) through Bering Strait into the Canada Basin, and counter-flowing Atlantic-origin water (AW) through Fram Strait and across the Barents Sea into the Nansen Basin. As a framework for biogeography within the AO, four basic, large-scale circulation systems (with L \&gt; 1000 km) are noted; these are: (1) the large scale wind-driven circulation which forces the cyclonic Trans-Polar Drift from Siberia to the Fram Strait and the anticyclonic Beaufort Gyre in the southern Canada Basin; (2) the circulation of waters that comprise the halocline complex, composed largely of waters of Pacific and Atlantic origin that are modified during passage over the Bering/Chukchi and Barents/Siberian shelves, respectively; (3) the topographically-trapped Arctic Circumpolar Boundary Current (ACBC) which carries AW cyclonically around the boundaries of the entire suite of basins, and (4) the very slow exchange of Arctic Ocean Deep Waters. Within the basin domain two basic water mass assemblies are observed, the difference between them being the absence or presence of PW sandwiched between Arctic Surface Waters (ASW) above and the AW complex below; the boundary between these domains is the Atlantic/Pacific halocline front. Both domains have vertical stratification that constrains the transfer of nutrients to the surface layer (euphotic zone), thus leading to their oligotrophic state, particularly in the more strongly stratified Pacific Arctic where, despite high nutrient values in the inflow, convective reset of surface layer nutrients by haline convection in winter is virtually absent. First and multi-year sea ice drastically alters albedo and insulates the underlying water column from extreme winter heat loss while its mechanical properties (thickness, concentration, roughness, etc.) greatly affect the efficiency of momentum transfer from the wind to the underlying water. Biologically, sea ice algal growth in the basins is proportionally almost equal to or exceeding phytoplankton production, and is a habitat and transport platform for sympagic (ice-associated) fauna. Owing to nutrient limitation due to strong stratification and light limitation due to snow and ice cover and extreme sun angle, primary production in the two basin domains is very low compared to the adjacent shelves. Severe nutrient limitation and complete euphotic zone drawdown in the AB favors small phytoplankton, a ubiquitous deep chlorophyll maximum layer, a low f-ratio of new to recycled carbon fixation, and a low energy food web. In contrast, nutrients persist –albeit in low levels– in the western EB, even in summer, suggesting light limitation, heavy grazing or both. The higher stocks of nutrients in the EB are more conducive to marginal ice blooms than in the AB. The large-scale ocean currents (NHTC and ACBC) import substantial expatriate, not locally reproducing zooplankton biomass especially from the adjoining subarctic Atlantic (primarily Calanus finmarchicus), but also from the Pacific (e.g., Pseudocalanus spp., Neocalanus spp. and Metridia pacifica). These advective inputs serve both as source of food to resident pelagic and benthic biota within the basins, and as potential grazers exerting top down control on limited phytoplankton resources. Benthic organisms within the AO basin show previously unappreciated biodiversity and surprising dispersion of species given the isolation of individual basins and low vertical carbon flux and resulting biomass. Larval dispersion is aided by the large-scale flows and perhaps, we hypothesize in the deep benthos by convective updrafts driven by geothermal heating. Zooplankton diversity, in contrast, is low, but again faunal assemblages are equally distributed between the EB and AB. Species pools of both pelagic and benthic communities change more with water depth rather than laterally, with the exception of expatriates and rare species, with close ties to today’s North Atlantic biogeographic region. Climate related change in the AO is thus manifest at significantly differing time scales. Throughout ∼90\% of the Pleistocene the AO has existed in glacial mode, with narrow continental shelves, greatly restricted river inflow, thicker and perhaps immobile sea ice, and total blockage of exchange with the Pacific Ocean. During the Holocene, on shorter time scales of 1000–100 years, significant changes in high latitude climate are tied to changes in temperature and perhaps moisture delivery patterns. The Arctic also experiences significant multi-decadal variability; however, the pace of change over the past three decades has been without precedent. Within the basin interior the ice is now thinner and less compact, and thus more responsive to wind stress (forcing and mixing). Concurrent with sea ice melt and increased river flow, the accumulation of fresh water and the stratification have increased, thus constraining vertical nutrient flux affecting phytoplankton size distributions, limiting primary production in parts of the basins now and likely in the future, and increasing vulnerability to acidification. In addition, sea ice is now retreating on an annual basis past the shelf break, exposing basin waters directly to sunlight and wind forcing. Thus, upwelling favorable winds (generally from east to west) can now directly and efficiently drive shelf-break upwelling, and draw nutrients from subsurface basin waters onto the shelf; at the same time upwelling favorable winds will also create onshore pressure gradients over the slope and basin which will act to slow or block the flow of waters in the ACBC, and thus alter advective pathways of both abiotic and biotic materials. Given the opening of a new ocean to multiple user groups, we expect that the central AO will play an increasing larger role both in the research and political arenas in the future, and we encourage pan-Arctic international collaboration over focus on territorial boundaries.},

Calanus overwinters in the deep basins of the Norwegian Sea, and gravid females must be advected onto the shelf prior to spawning if eggs and nauplii larvae are to serve as food for fish larvae. In this study, cross-shelf advection of calanus is simulated over 52 years (1960-2011), using a numerical ocean model coupled with an individual-based model. The results suggest that cross-shelf transport of calanus is surprisingly stable across years, and that transport is particularly concentrated immediately upstream of the two major spawning areas for the Northeast Arctic cod and the Norwegian spring spawning herring, namely Lofoten and Møre, respectively. Two large topographical features, the Træna trough and the Norwegian trench, appear to be funnelling calanus onto the shelf in these two areas. This could suggest that ...},

	abstract = {The study of animal foraging behaviour is of practical ecological importance, and exemplifies the wider scientific problem of optimizing search strategies. Lévy flights are random walks, the step lengths of which come from probability distributions with heavy power-law tails, such that clusters of short steps are connected by rare long steps. Lévy flights display fractal properties, have no typical scale, and occur in physical and chemical systems. An attempt to demonstrate their existence in a natural biological system presented evidence that wandering albatrosses perform Lévy flights when searching for prey on the ocean surface. This well known finding was followed by similar inferences about the search strategies of deer and bumblebees. These pioneering studies have triggered much theoretical work in physics (for example, refs 11, 12), as well as empirical ecological analyses regarding reindeer, microzooplankton, grey seals, spider monkeys and fishing boats. Here we analyse a new, high-resolution data set of wandering albatross flights, and find no evidence for Lévy flight behaviour. Instead we find that flight times are gamma distributed, with an exponential decay for the longest flights. We re-analyse the original albatross data using additional information, and conclude that the extremely long flights, essential for demonstrating Lévy flight behaviour, were spurious. Furthermore, we propose a widely applicable method to test for power-law distributions using likelihood and Akaike weights. We apply this to the four original deer and bumblebee data sets, finding that none exhibits evidence of Lévy flights, and that the original graphical approach is insufficient. Such a graphical approach has been adopted to conclude Lévy flight movement for other organisms, and to propose Lévy flight analysis as a potential real-time ecosystem monitoring tool. Our results question the strength of the empirical evidence for biological Lévy flights.},

	abstract = {Bigger animals live longer. The scaling exponent for the relationship between lifespan and body mass is between 0.15 and 0.3. Bigger animals also expend more energy, and the scaling exponent for the relationship of resting metabolic rate (RMR) to body mass lies somewhere between 0.66 and 0.8. Mass-specific RMR therefore scales with a corresponding exponent between -0.2 and -0.33. Because the exponents for mass-specific RMR are close to the exponents for lifespan, but have opposite signs, their product (the mass-specific expenditure of energy per lifespan) is independent of body mass (exponent between -0.08 and 0.08). This means that across species a gram of tissue on average expends about the same amount of energy before it dies regardless of whether that tissue is located in a shrew, a cow, an elephant or a whale. This fact led to the notion that ageing and lifespan are processes regulated by energy metabolism rates and that elevating metabolism will be associated with premature mortality - the rate of living theory.
The free-radical theory of ageing provides a potential mechanism that links metabolism to ageing phenomena, since oxygen free radicals are formed as a by-product of oxidative phosphorylation. Despite this potential synergy in these theoretical approaches, the free-radical theory has grown in stature while the rate of living theory has fallen into disrepute. This is primarily because comparisons made across classes (for example, between birds and mammals) do not conform to the expectations, and even within classes there is substantial interspecific variability in the mass-specific expenditure of energy per lifespan. Using interspecific data to test the rate of living hypothesis is, however, confused by several major problems. For example, appeals that the resultant lifetime expenditure of energy per gram of tissue is `too variable' depend on the biological significance rather than the statistical significance of the variation observed. Moreover, maximum lifespan is not a good marker of ageing and RMR is not a good measure of total energy metabolism. Analysis of residual lifespan against residual RMR reveals no significant relationship. However, this is still based on RMR.
A novel comparison using daily energy expenditure (DEE), rather than BMR, suggests that lifetime expenditure of energy per gram of tissue is NOT independent of body mass, and that tissue in smaller animals expends more energy before expiring than tissue in larger animals. Some of the residual variation in this relationship in mammals is explained by ambient temperature. In addition there is a significant negative relationship between residual lifespan and residual daily energy expenditure in mammals. A potentially much better model to explore the links of body size, metabolism and ageing is to examine the intraspecific links. These studies have generated some data that support the original rate of living theory and other data that conflict. In particular several studies have shown that manipulating animals to expend more or less energy generate the expected effects on lifespan (particularly when the subjects are ectotherms). However, smaller individuals with higher rates of metabolism live longer than their slower, larger conspecifics.
An addition to these confused observations has been the recent suggestion that under some circumstances we might expect mitochondria to produce fewer free radicals when metabolism is higher - particularly when they are uncoupled. These new ideas concerning the manner in which mitochondria generate free radicals as a function of metabolism shed some light on the complexity of observations linking body size, metabolism and lifespan.},

Nauplii prey being abundant above 50 m, the upward night-time incursions of the omnivore Metridia longa seldom reached beyond {\textless}25 m. In the absence of UV-B radiation or a temperature gradient, migration out of the euphotic layer was interpreted as a reaction to visual predators (e.g. Arctic cod Boreogadus saida and the hyperiid amphipod Themisto libellula). Swarms of T. libellula actively preying on copepods accumulated at the ice–water interface at dusk. Low vulnerability to visual predators and a more uniform vertical distribution of their food explained the limited DVM of the small omnivores Microcalanus pygmaeus, Oithona similis and Oncaea borealis. Once the feeding migrations developed, the daytime depth of the centre of mass of the distribution of a copepod was correlated to its size (r2 = 0.63). Our observations suggest that, under Arctic sea ice, interspecific differences in the pattern and extent of copepod DVM can be related to the vertical distribution of potential food and to vulnerability to visual predators.},

We found that mouse Clock–Bmal1 recruits the Ddb1–Cullin-4 ubiquitin ligase to Per (Per1 and Per2), Cry (Cry1 and Cry2) and other circadian target genes. Histone H2B monoubiquitination at Per genes was rhythmic and depended on Bmal1, Ddb1 and Cullin-4a. Depletion of Ddb1–Cullin-4a or an independent decrease in H2B monoubiquitination caused defective circadian feedback and decreased the association of the Per complex with DNA-bound Clock–Bmal1. Clock–Bmal1 thus covalently marks Per genes for subsequent recruitment of the Per complex. Our results reveal a chromatin-mediated signal from the positive to the negative limb of the clock that provides a licensing mechanism for circadian feedback.},

	abstract = {This study addresses how local abiotic variability links zooplankton stocks to climate systems. Four zooplankton species and abiotic environmental data were sampled annually during October and February 1983–2005 in two northern Norwegian fjord basins. Inter-decadal change in abundance occurred in both fjords but differed between the two communities, presumably resulting from combinations of topography, specific life history strategies and preference for ambient water qualities before advective migration into the habitats. The shallow Mistfjord sill led to accumulation of coastal water in the fjord basin, while the deeper Saltfjord sill allowed frequent seasonal exchange of Atlantic basin water. Changes in basin water temperature and salinity were decadal in the Mistfjord basin, and inter-annual in the Saltfjord basin. Several biotic and abiotic variables co-varied with climate indices, which indicate causal relationships between hemispheric climate variability and abundance of over-wintering zooplankton, but the processes involved are not fully understood. Tropospheric processes generating North Atlantic Oscillation apparently forced vernal freshwater discharge from Norway, summer reproduction in neritic waters and geographic distribution of basin-scale population systems. Stratospheric forcing as indicated by the Arctic Oscillation seems to be involved in geophysical relationships that influence dynamic processes in zooplankton population systems within the Arctic Mediterranean.},

As part of this effort we conducted Video Plankton Recorder (VPR) surveys during austral fall and winter, 2001. The VPR survey yielded high-resolution distributions of larval krill, other plankton, and marine snow in relation to hydrography from a series of transect lines orthogonal to the coast on the continental shelf of the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Four taxa (larval krill, copepods, polychaetes, pteropods) and marine snow were numerous during fall; much lower abundances of all categories were present during winter, with only larval krill, copepods, and polychaetes present in any abundance. Distributions of plankton and marine snow were associated with water-mass types and the vertical structure of the environment, particularly for larval krill that were primarily associated with the pycnocline. During fall, larval krill were present across the entire shelf, with high abundances at the shelf break. Copepods were most numerous at depth during fall, consistent with ontogenetic migration to depth at the onset of winter.},

	abstract = {The Southern Ocean ecosystem is undergoing rapid physical and biological changes that are likely to have profound implications for higher-order predators. Here we compare the long-term, historical responses of Southern Ocean predators to climate change. We examine palaeoecological evidence for changes in the abundance and distribution of seabirds and marine mammals, and place these into context with palaeoclimate records in order to identify key environmental drivers associated with population changes. Our synthesis revealed two key factors underlying Southern Ocean predator population changes; 1) the availability of ice-free ground for breeding, and 2) access to productive foraging grounds. The processes of glaciation and sea ice fluctuation were key; the distributions and abundances of elephant seals, snow petrels, gentoo, chinstrap and Adélie penguins all responded strongly to the emergence of new breeding habitat coincident with deglaciation and reductions in sea ice. Access to productive foraging grounds was another limiting factor, with snow petrels, king and emperor penguins all affected by reduced prey availability in the past. Several species were isolated in glacial refugia and there is evidence that refuge populations were supported by polynyas. While the underlying drivers of population change were similar across most Southern Ocean predators, the individual responses of species to environmental change varied because of species specific factors such as dispersal ability and environmental sensitivity. Such interspecific differences are likely to affect the future climate change responses of Southern Ocean marine predators and should be considered in conservation plans. Comparative palaeoecological studies are a valuable source of long-term data on species’ responses to environmental change that can provide important insights into future climate change responses. This synthesis highlights the importance of protecting productive foraging grounds proximate to breeding locations, as well as the potential role of polynyas as future Southern Ocean refugia.

The current understanding of Arctic ecosystems is deeply rooted in the classical view of a bottom-up controlled system with strong physical forcing and seasonality in primary-production regimes. Consequently, the Arctic polar night is commonly disregarded as a time of year when biological activities are reduced to a minimum due to a reduced food supply. Here, based upon a multidisciplinary ecosystem-scale study from the polar night at 79°N, we present an entirely different view. Instead of an ecosystem that has entered a resting state, we document a system with high activity levels and biological interactions across most trophic levels. In some habitats, biological diversity and presence of juvenile stages were elevated in winter months compared to the more productive and sunlit periods. Ultimately, our results suggest a different perspective regarding ecosystem function that will be of importance for future environmental management and decision making, especially at a time when Arctic regions are experiencing accelerated environmental change [1].},

	abstract = {The light regime is an ecologically important factor in pelagic habitats, influencing a range of biological processes. However, the availability and importance of light to these processes in high Arctic zooplankton communities during periods of 'complete' darkness (polar night) are poorly studied. Here we characterized the ambient light regime throughout the diel cycle during the high Arctic polar night, and ask whether visual systems of Arctic zooplankton can detect the low levels of irradiance available at this time. To this end, light measurements with a purpose-built irradiance sensor and coupled all-sky digital photographs were used to characterize diel skylight irradiance patterns over 24 hours at 79°N in January 2014 and 2015. Subsequent skylight spectral irradiance and in-water optical property measurements were used to model the underwater light field as a function of depth, which was then weighted by the electrophysiologically determined visual spectral sensitivity of a dominant high Arctic zooplankter, Thysanoessa inermis. Irradiance in air ranged between 1–1.5 x 10-5 μmol photons m-2 s-1 (400–700 nm) in clear weather conditions at noon and with the moon below the horizon, hence values reflect only solar illumination. Radiative transfer modelling generated underwater light fields with peak transmission at blue-green wavelengths, with a 465 nm transmission maximum in shallow water shifting to 485 nm with depth. To the eye of a zooplankter, light from the surface to 75 m exhibits a maximum at 485 nm, with longer wavelengths ({\textgreater}600 nm) being of little visual significance. Our data are the first quantitative characterisation, including absolute intensities, spectral composition and photoperiod of biologically relevant solar ambient light in the high Arctic during the polar night, and indicate that some species of Arctic zooplankton are able to detect and utilize ambient light down to 20–30m depth during the Arctic polar night.},

First, the polar night is not a period void of biological activity even though primary production is close to zero, but is rather characterized by a number of processes and interactions yet to be fully understood, including unanticipated high levels of feeding and reproduction in a wide range of taxa and habitats. Second, as more knowledge emerges, it is evident that a coupled physical and biological perspective of the ecosystem will redefine seasonality beyond the “calendar perspective”. Third, it appears that many organisms may exhibit endogenous rhythms that trigger fitness-maximizing activities in the absence of light-based cues. Indeed a common adaptation appears to be the ability to utilize the dark season for reproduction. This and other processes are most likely adaptations to current environmental conditions and community and trophic structures of the ecosystem, and may have implications for how Arctic ecosystems can change under continued climatic warming.},

	abstract = {Near-bottom zooplankton communities have rarely been studied despite numerous reports of high zooplankton concentrations, probably due to methodological constraints. In Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, the near-bottom layer was studied for the first time by combining daytime deployments of a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), the optical zooplankton sensor moored on-sight key species investigation (MOKI), and Tucker trawl sampling. ROV data from the fjord entrance and the inner fjord showed high near-bottom abundances of euphausiids with a mean concentration of 17.3 ± 3.5 n × 100 m−3. With the MOKI system, we observed varying numbers of euphausiids, amphipods, chaetognaths, and copepods on the seafloor at six stations. Light-induced zooplankton swarms reached densities in the order of 90,000 (euphausiids), 120,000 (amphipods), and 470,000 ind m−3 (chaetognaths), whereas older copepodids of Calanus hyperboreus and C. glacialis did not respond to light. They were abundant at the seafloor and 5 and 15 m above and showed maximum abundance of 65,000 ind m−3. Tucker trawl data provided an overview of the seasonal vertical distribution of euphausiids. The most abundant species Thysanoessa inermis reached near-bottom concentrations of 270 ind m−3. Regional distribution was neither related to depth nor to location in the fjord. The taxa observed were all part of the pelagic community. Our observations suggest the presence of near-bottom macrozooplankton also in other regions and challenge the current view of bentho–pelagic coupling. Neglecting this community may cause severe underestimates of the stock of pelagic zooplankton, especially predatory species, which link secondary production with higher trophic levels.},

	abstract = {Arctic shelf zooplankton communities are dominated by the copepod Calanus glacialis. This species feeds in surface waters during spring and summer and accumulates large amounts of lipids. Autumn and winter are spent in dormancy in deeper waters. Lipids are believed to play a major role in regulating buoyancy, however, they cannot explain fine-tuning of the depth distribution. To investigate whether ion exchange processes and acid-base regulation support ontogenetic migration as suggested for Antarctic copepods, we sampled C. glacialis in monthly intervals for 1 yr in a high-Arctic fjord and determined cation concentrations and the extracellular pH (pHe) in its hemolymph. During the winter/spring transition, prior to the upward migration of the copepods, Li+ ions were exchanged with cations (Na+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) leading to Li+ concentrations of 197 mmol L−1. This likely decreased the density and promoted upward migration in C. glacialis. Our data thus suggest that Li+ has a biological function in this species. Ion and pHe regulation in the hemolymph were not directly correlated, but the pHe revealed a seasonal pattern and was low (5.5) in winter and high (7.9) in summer. Low pHe during overwintering might be related to metabolic depression and thus, support diapause.},

	abstract = {The vertical distribution patterns of the dominant zooplankton in the vicinity of Marguerite Bay on the west side of the Antarctic Peninsula were studied during austral fall of 2001 and 2002, using net and concurrent environmental data. Vertical distributions of zooplankton usually were similar to those reported for other Antarctic regions. Maximum abundances of the copepods Ctenocalanus spp. and Calanus propinquus, the euphausiids Euphausia superba, Euphausia crystallorophias, and Thysanoessa macrura, and appendicularians primarily occurred in shallow Antarctic Surface Water (\&lt;100 m) or the upper pycnocline. The copepod, Oncaea spp., mysids, and ostracods had the deepest distributions (\&gt;250 m), in warmer modified Circumpolar Deep Water. Other dominant copepods (Calanoides acutus, Metridia gerlachei, Oithona spp., Paraeuchaeta spp., and Rhincalanus gigas), pteropods, and chaetognaths had depths of maximum abundance within the pycnocline or in deeper warmer waters. Overlapping depth distributions suggest that E. superba would have the highest prey encounter rates with M. gerlachei, Ctenocalanus spp., C. propinquus, and Oithona spp. during fall, although most of the copepod community was deeper than the euphausiid community. Even though the three euphausiid species occupied similar depth ranges on average, at any given location E. superba, E. crystallorophias, and T. macrura depths of maximum abundance often did not overlap, suggesting vertical habitat partitioning behavior. The vertical patterns of copepods, euphausiids, amphipods, and mysids did not have a consistent association with the distributions of pigments, temperature, salinity, or density. Instead, the observed vertical distributions are mainly attributed to different behaviors, including seasonal vertical migration to deeper water for overwintering (i.e., C. acutus, R. gigas, ostracods, chaetognaths, pteropods) and vertical habitat partitioning to reduce competition (i.e., euphausiids). Migration into deep water and aggregation behavior (i.e., euphausiids) also reduce the risk of predation.},

Although most core clock factors are transcription factors, post-transcriptional control introduces delays that are critical for circadian oscillations. Little work has been done on circadian regulation of translation, so to address this deficit we conducted ribosome profiling experiments in a human cell model for an autonomous clock. We found that most rhythmic gene expression occurs with little delay between transcription and translation, suggesting that the lag in the accumulation of some clock proteins relative to their mRNAs does not arise from regulated translation. Nevertheless, we found that translation occurs in a circadian fashion for many genes, sometimes imposing an additional level of control on rhythmically expressed mRNAs and, in other cases, conferring rhythms on non-cycling mRNAs. Most cyclically transcribed RNAs are translated at one of two major times in a 24h day, while rhythmic translation of most non-cyclic RNAs is phased to a single time of day. Unexpectedly, we found that the clock also regulates the formation of cytoplasmic processing (P) bodies, which control the fate of mRNAs, suggesting circadian coordination of mRNA metabolism and translation.},

During overflow, dense fluid forms a turbulent plume whose observed behaviour is similar to that expected from theory: an entrainment constant of 0.013 is found on a bottom slope of 6 °. Observations of salinity in the sill region show that the flushing time there is 4 weeks and that this is the response time of the renewal mechanism to changes in runoff. A model of the non-linear dependence of renewal upon runoff is made and used to hindcast during 1964–1975. The hindcast is verified and shows that renewal is aperiodic with a mean repetition time of 113 years.},

	abstract = {The phylum Ctenophora (known as comb jellies) consists of gelatinous marine carnivores found from the surface to several thousand meters depth. Their morphology can be simple or complex, ranging from a sac-like shape with no tentacles to large lobed forms with sinuous “auricles,” papillae, and two different kinds of tentacles. This diversity appears to reflect adaptations to many different diets. For example, some species can continuously “graze” on small crustaceans or larvae, others engulf larger jellies, and some are able to snare individual larger prey through a variety of strategies. Thus feeding behavior can help explain the high morphological diversity in this relatively small phylum. Because of their fragility, comb jellies are difficult to study alive and the natural histories of many types, especially those found in the deep sea, have not been examined. This account categorizes ctenophore feeding methods using published reports as well as new observations using submersibles and blue-water scuba diving.},

Seasonal feeding was examined from 1977/1978 (November–March). The diel feeding cycle was investigated during a 96 h station established in February 1976, while food selection was analyzed using larvae and zooplankton samples collected in February 1982. Hatching occurs in early spring, and larvae fed on eggs of calanoid copepods and on cyclopoid copepods. Copepod eggs were the principal food near the pack ice, and cyclopoids in open waters. Cyclopoids were the staple food in summer. Eggs of the Antarctic krillEuphausia superba were ingested selectively and formed major portions of the larval summer diet in neritic (Joinville Island) and oceanic (Elephant Island) spawning areas ofE. superba. In the fall, copepods predominated in the diets. Most abundant and most frequently ingested prey in summer and fall wereOncaea spp. Feeding commenced at dawn and continued at least until dusk. Krill eggs were taken chiefly during morning hours and egg incidence declined during the day, suggesting that eggs were ingested soon after spawning. Prey size at the onset of feeding was estimated as 0.130 to 0.330 mm. Size-selective feeding was evident in small larvae, while in larger larvae median prey length remained constant. High feeding incidence among yolk-sac larvae in spring, high overall feeding incidence in summer, and size-selective foraging of small larvae suggested favorable feeding conditions in the 1977/1978 season. Yolk-absorption times in Antarctic fish larvae vary on a scale of weeks and may be further retarded due to early feeding. Hence, year-to-year variability of yolk incidence inN. larseni indicated variable biotic environments of early feeding larvae rather than temporal shifts of hatching periods. As hatching periods are constant between years in contrast to the variable retreat of the pack ice and subsequent onset of the production cycle in space and time, maternal yolk reserves are probably utilized to compensate for such variations.},

	abstract = {A one-dimensional, temperature-dependent model was used to simulate the descent–ascent cycle of the embryos and early larval stages of Antarctic krill to determine which regions of the western Antarctic Peninsula (wAP) continental shelf support successful completion of this cycle under present environmental conditions and those projected to occur as a result of climate change. The transport and fate of the embryo and larva under present and modified conditions was investigated with Lagrangian particle tracking simulations. The two modeling studies were implemented using temperature and density (embryo–larva model) and circulation distributions (Lagrangian particle tracking) obtained from a high resolution version of the Regional Ocean Modeling System configured for the wAP shelf region. Additional simulations used temperature and circulation distributions obtained from simulations that were forced with increased wind speed and increased transport of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), both projected to possibly occur with climate change in the wAP region. Simulations using present conditions showed that successful completion of the descent–ascent cycle occurred along the outer shelf and on the shelf in regions with bottom depths of 600–700 m. Estimated residence times for the shelf regions that support success of the embryo and larva were 20–30 days. Thus, krill spawned in the mid and inner shelf regions can be retained in these regions through development to the first feeding stage (calyptopis 1). Increased winds and ACC transport resulted in more onshelf transport of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), which increased the volume of warm (1–1.5 °C) water at depth. These conditions supported a moderate increase in success of the krill embryo and larva, but only for limited areas of the shelf where hatching depths decreased by 10–30 m (\&lt;5\%) and development time to the calyptopis 1 stage decreased by 15–20\%. The modified circulation conditions also supported increased advection of krill larvae into areas of the shelf that would experience the largest reduction of sea ice, especially in winter. Projected changes in wind strength and CDW transport may potentially enhance larval survival and advection onto the wAP shelf, but recruitment may be decreased by modifications to local sea ice distributions that would impede survival of Antarctic krill that overwinter on the shelf.},

C. antarctica had relatively high carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) values (average: 8.4\% C and 1.8 \% N [\% dry weight, DW]), further suggesting that polar ctenophores are more C-rich than tropical species. Winter oxygen consumption and ammonium excretion rates ranged from 0.059 to 0.411 µl O2 mg–1 DW h–1 and 0.043 to 2.22 nmol N mg–1 DW h–1, respectively, at 0°C. Calanoid copepods, larval and juvenile Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, and a mixture of prey were offered to ctenophores during feeding incubations. Ingestion rates based on preliminary feeding experiments were linearly related to prey densities, with rates ranging from 9 to 39 prey ind.–1 d–1 and from 3.5 to 4.0 prey ind.–1 d–1 for 1 larger and 1 smaller C. antarctica, respectively. Daily rations varied between 22 and 136\% of body C for the larger ctenophore and 6 to 22\% of body C for the smaller individual. Digestion time (median: 11.5 h) was dependent on prey elemental content and prey number, and independent of ctenophore size. Gut content analyses indicated that C. antarctica preyed predominantly on larval euphausiids and copepods. Diver observations, net collections, and diet analyses suggest that this species is an opportunistic predator that feeds both during the day and night, and appears to be well adapted to the prey patchiness found in Antarctic waters.},

	abstract = {Circadian clocks drive daily oscillations in a variety of biological processes through the coordinate orchestration of precise gene expression programs. Global expression profiling experiments have suggested that a significant fraction of the transcriptome and proteome is under circadian control, and such output rhythms have historically been assumed to rely on the rhythmic transcription of these genes. Recent genome-wide studies, however, have challenged this long-held view and pointed to a major contribution of posttranscriptional regulation in driving oscillations at the messenger RNA (mRNA) level, while others have highlighted extensive clock translational regulation, regardless of mRNA rhythms. There are various examples of genes that are uniformly transcribed throughout the day but that exhibit rhythmic mRNA levels, and of flat mRNAs, with oscillating protein levels, and such observations have largely been considered to result from independent regulation at each step. These studies have thereby obviated any connections, or coupling, that might exist between the different steps of gene expression and the impact that any of them could have on subsequent ones. Here, we argue that due to both biological and technical reasons, the jury is still out on the determination of the relative contributions of each of the different stages of gene expression in regulating output molecular rhythms. In addition, we propose that through a variety of coupling mechanisms, gene transcription (even when apparently arrhythmic) might play a much relevant role in determining oscillations in gene expression than currently estimated, regulating rhythms at downstream steps. Furthermore, we posit that eukaryotic genomes regulate daily RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) recruitment and histone modifications genome-wide, setting the stage for global nascent transcription, but that tissue-specific mechanisms locally specify the different processes under clock control.},

In the mouse liver, CLOCK and BMAL1 interact with the regulatory regions of thousands of genes, which are both cyclically and constitutively expressed. The circadian transcription in the liver is clustered in phase and this is accompanied by circadian occupancy of RNA polymerase II recruitment and initiation. These changes also lead to circadian fluctuations in histone H3 lysine4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) as well as H3 lysine9 acetylation (H3K9ac) and H3 lysine27 acetylation (H3K27ac). Thus, the circadian clock regulates global transcriptional poise and chromatin state by regulation of RNA polymerase II.},

Multivariate and univariate statistical analysis was used to identify those metabolites whose concentrations oscillate diurnally. We compared metabolite levels at two time points twelve hours apart, one close to the end of the day and the other close to the end of the night, and identified metabolites that differed significantly in their relative concentrations. We were able to identify 14 such metabolites whose concentrations differed significantly between the two time points. The concentrations of metabolites such as sterols, fatty acids, amino acids such as leucine, valine, isoleucine, alanine and lysine as well as other metabolites such as creatine, glucose, AMP and NAD were higher close to the end of the night, whereas the levels of lactic acid, and a few amino acids such as histidine and tryptophan were higher close to the end of the day. We compared signal intensities across 12 equally spaced time points for these 14 metabolites, in order to profile the changes in their levels across the day, since the NMR metabolite peak intensity is directly proportional to its molar concentration. Through this report we establish NMR-based metabolomics combined with multivariate statistical analysis as a useful method for future studies on the interactions between circadian clocks and metabolic processes.},

During two feeding experiments, E.pacifica were offered cells of the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii, TEP, or both TEP and T.weissflogii cells. Ingestion rates on cells were lower in the presence of TEP. However, contrary to the hypothesis, grazing on cells was not inhibited by TEP. Rather, TEP-clusters, aggregates which formed from TEP and nano-sized particles normally too small for the filtering apparatus of E.pacifica to retain, served as an alternative food source for E.pacifica, reducing their ingestion of cells. These clusters were very similar in form to the TEP actually available to marine grazers in nature. TEP-clusters were similar to cells in size and food quality, and were grazed at similar rates. When feeding on TEP-clusters, euphausiids short circuit the food web by feeding on nano- and picoplankton directly, bypassing the microbial loop. Thus, the presence of TEP appears to enhance, rather than depress, macrozooplankton grazing.},

TEP consumption increased with TEP concentration and the presence of TEP did not inhibit ingestion of cells. However, because of their low carbon content, TEP contributed only 15\% to total carbon consumption in the presence of phytoplankton food. While copepods consumed pure TEP in this study, sticky TEP in nature contain abundant inclusions of bacteria and microorganisms too small for copepods to capture individually.

	abstract = {Alfalfa seed production in the northwestern United States and western Canada is heavily dependent upon the pollinating services of Megachile rotundata (F.) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae). M. rotundata females nest in cavities either naturally occurring or in artificial nesting blocks. Because of the physical nature of the nest, M. rotundata brood may have limited to no exposure to photoperiodic cues in order to regulate important circadian functions. Therefore, various thermoperiod regimes were used to characterize the possible role of thermoperiodism in synchronizing M. rotundata adult emergence. Adult emergence was monitored using a microprocessor-controlled event logger. Incubating bees under constant 29°C and darkness resulted in an arhythmic adult emergence pattern. Exposing developing M. rotundata to a thermoperiod synchronized emergence to the beginning of the thermophase and decreased the total number of days required for all adults to emerge. The amplitude of the thermoperiod regulated the timing of peak emergence in relationship to the increase in temperature. A thermoperiod amplitude of only 2°C was sufficient to synchronize peak adult emergence to take place during the rise in temperature. Increasing the amplitude of the thermoperiod to 4 or 8°C caused a positively correlated shift in peak emergence to later in the thermophase. Brood stored under constant 29°C and darkness for different durations (May or June early in the growing season or July or August late in the growing season) or under a fluctuating thermal regime (base temperature of 6°C and daily 1-h pulse of 20°C until September or November) maintained their capacity for entraining emergence timing by thermoperiodism.},

	abstract = {Two sediment cores from inner Loch Etive, a deep fjord basin on the west coast of Scotland, reveal a continuous sediment sequence spanning the last 10,000 yr. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages indicate that marine conditions prevailed in Loch Etive throughout the Holocene. However, changes in sediment grain size composition and magnetic susceptibility suggest that the strength and frequency of deep water renewal events has varied through time. This exchange with coastal water is controlled mainly by relative sea level changes (influencing sill depth) and the influx of freshwater to the loch. The very early Holocene sediments are well-sorted coarse silt–fine sands, with a diverse assemblage of calcareous foraminifera indicating frequent renewal of bottom waters. During this period, immediately following the withdrawal of Younger Dryas glaciers, denudation rates were high in the catchment area. The period 9–7 ky BP, during which relative sea level rose in this part of W Scotland, is characterised by highly variable environments. The grain size data indicate an enhanced transport of sandy bed load material from the ‘Bonawe Sill’ region to the basin deep during the mid-Holocene relative sea level high (8–9 m higher than present). High relative sea levels at this time would explain the occurrence of frequent, vigorous deep water renewal events and an increased tidal current regime in the loch. The late Holocene record is characterised by an upward fining of sediment grain size, disappearance of calcareous benthic foraminifera and increasing organic content; suggesting a development towards a more restricted fjordic circulation in response to the progressive lowering of relative sea level. A sudden acceleration in this late Holocene trend took place during the last millennium, during which time human land use and deforestation have influenced the sediment and organic material flux to Loch Etive. It appears that average Holocene sediment accumulation rates in the ‘Bonawe Deep’ were about 0.01–0.03 g cm− 2 yr− 1, which is far below modern estimates for the site. This can be explained by vigorous bottom current activity during much of the Holocene, leading to a low net depositional rate.},

	abstract = {The zooplankton community of Marguerite Bay was studied during austral fall of 2001 and 2002 using net and concurrent environmental data. Interannual differences were observed in zooplankton species composition, developmental stages, and abundances, which were linked to unusually high chlorophyll concentrations in the Bellingshausen Sea and Marguerite Bay during spring–summer 2000/2001. Copepod abundance was significantly higher in 2001 than in 2002 (46.3 and 28.3 ind m−3 in 2001 and 2002, respectively). During 2001, the copepod community was dominated by two species. Calanoides acutus, a herbivore, and Metridia gerlachei, an omnivore, accounted for 46\% and 45\% of the community, respectively. During 2002, however, several species were relatively abundant, including M. gerlachei, Ctenocalanus spp., C. acutus, Oithona spp., and Paraeuchaeta spp. Euphausiids also showed a rapid population response to high chlorophyll levels in 2001. Even though average total euphausiid (juvenile/adult) abundances were similar during both years (0.20 and 0.15 ind m−3 for 2001 and 2002, respectively), species composition showed marked interannual differences due to varying life history strategies among species. Thysanoessa macrura, which has a relatively rapid development from larval to juvenile stages between spring and fall of the same year, was the most abundant euphausiid in 2001. In contrast, Euphausia crystallorophias and Euphausia superba juvenile/adult populations increased in 2002, owing to a slower development in which larval stages overwinter and recruit to juveniles during the following spring/summer. Other zooplankton groups those were abundant in Marguerite Bay, but showed little variability between years, included ostracods, pteropods, chaetognaths, medusae, amphipods, and mysids. Summer phytoplankton concentrations strongly influenced copepods and euphausiids; however, there were no clear associations between zooplankton distributions and fall environmental conditions (i.e., pigment concentrations and surface salinity) or bottom depth. It is notable that ostracods and pteropods had the highest abundances of non-copepod zooplankton.},

Samples were collected in the spring, summer and autumn in stratified hauls (according to hydrographic characteristics), by means of a 0.180-mm Multi Plankton Sampler. A strong front between the open sea and the fjord waters was observed during the spring, preventing water mass exchange, but was not observed later in the season. The considerable seasonal changes in zooplankton abundance were related to the seasonal variation in hydrographical regime. The total zooplankton abundance during the spring (40–2010 individuals m−3) was much lower than in the summer and autumn (410–10 560 individuals m−3). The main factors shaping the zooplankton community in the fjord include: the presence of a local front, advection, the flow pattern and the decreasing depth of the basin in the inner fjord. Presumably these factors regulate the gross pattern of zooplankton density and distribution, and override the importance of biological processes. This study increased our understanding of seasonal processes in fjords, particularly with regard to the strong seasonal variability in the Arctic.},

	abstract = {Understanding the patterns and causes of phenotypic divergence is a central goal in evolutionary biology. Much work has shown that mRNA abundance is highly variable between closely related species. However, the extent and mechanisms of post-transcriptional gene regulatory evolution are largely unknown. Here we used ribosome profiling to compare transcript abundance and translation efficiency in two closely related yeast species (S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus). By comparing translation regulatory divergence to interspecies differences in mRNA sequence features, we show that differences in transcript leaders and codon bias substantially contribute to divergent translation. Globally, we find that translation regulatory divergence often buffers species differences in mRNA abundance, such that ribosome occupancy is more conserved than transcript abundance. We used allele-specific ribosome profiling in interspecies hybrids to compare the relative contributions of cis- and trans-regulatory divergence to species differences in mRNA abundance and translation efficiency. The mode of gene regulatory divergence differs for these processes, as trans-regulatory changes play a greater role in divergent mRNA abundance than in divergent translation efficiency. Strikingly, most genes with aberrant transcript abundance in F1 hybrids (either over- or underexpressed compared to both parent species) did not exhibit aberrant ribosome occupancy. Our results show that interspecies differences in translation contribute substantially to the evolution of gene expression. Compensatory differences in transcript abundance and translation efficiency may increase the robustness of gene regulation.},

Circadian clocks integrate light and temperature input to remain synchronized with the day/night cycle. Although light input to the clock is well studied, the molecular mechanisms by which circadian clocks respond to temperature remain poorly understood. We found that temperature phase shifts Drosophila circadian clocks through degradation of the pacemaker protein TIM. This degradation is mechanistically distinct from photic CRY-dependent TIM degradation. Thermal TIM degradation is triggered by cytosolic calcium increase and CALMODULIN binding to TIM and is mediated by the atypical calpain protease SOL. This thermal input pathway and CRY-dependent light input thus converge on TIM, providing a molecular mechanism for the integration of circadian light and temperature inputs. Mammals use body temperature cycles to keep peripheral clocks synchronized with their brain pacemaker. Interestingly, downregulating the mammalian SOL homolog SOLH blocks thermal mPER2 degradation and phase shifts. Thus, we propose that circadian thermosensation in insects and mammals share common principles.},

	abstract = {1.In seasonal climates, dormancy is a common strategy that structures biodiversity and is necessary for the persistence of many species. Climate change will likely alter dormancy dynamics in zooplankton, the basis of aquatic food webs, by altering two important hatching cues: mean temperatures during the ice-free season, and mean day length when lakes become ice free. Theory suggests that these changes could alter diversity, hatchling abundances and phenology within lakes, and that these responses may diverge across latitudes due to differences in optimal hatching cues and strategies. 2.To examine the role of temperature and day length on hatching dynamics, we collected sediment from 25 lakes across a 1800 km latitudinal gradient and exposed sediment samples to a factorial combination of two photoperiods (12 and 16 hours) and two temperatures (8°C and 12 °C) representative of historical southern (short photoperiod, warm) and northern (long photoperiod, cool) lake conditions. We tested whether sensitivity to these hatching cues varies by latitudinal origin and differs among taxa. 3.Higher temperatures advanced phenology for all taxa, and these advances were greatest for cladocerans followed by copepods and rotifers. Although phenology differed among taxa, the effect of temperature did not vary with latitude. The latitudinal origin of the egg bank influenced egg abundance and hatchling abundance and diversity, with these latter effects varying with taxa, temperature and photoperiod. 4.Copepod hatchling abundances peaked at mid latitudes in the high temperature and long photoperiod treatments, whereas hatchling abundances of other zooplankton were greatest at low latitudes and high temperature. The overall diversity of crustacean zooplankton (copepods and cladocerans) also reflected distinct responses of each taxa to our treatments, with the greatest diversity occurring at mid latitudes ({\textasciitilde}56° N) in the shorter photoperiod treatment. 5.Our results demonstrate that hatching cues differ for broad taxonomic groups that vary in developmental and life-history strategies. These differences are predicted to drive latitude-specific shifts in zooplankton emergence with climate change, and could alter the base of aquatic food webs. This article is protected by copyright.

	abstract = {Circadian clocks are endogenous timers adjusting behaviour and physiology with the solar day. Synchronized circadian clocks improve fitness and are crucial for our physical and mental well-being. Visual and non-visual photoreceptors are responsible for synchronizing circadian clocks to light, but clock-resetting is also achieved by alternating day and night temperatures with only 2–4 °C difference. This temperature sensitivity is remarkable considering that the circadian clock period ({\textasciitilde}24 h) is largely independent of surrounding ambient temperatures. Here we show that Drosophila Ionotropic Receptor 25a (IR25a) is required for behavioural synchronization to low-amplitude temperature cycles. This channel is expressed in sensory neurons of internal stretch receptors previously implicated in temperature synchronization of the circadian clock. IR25a is required for temperature-synchronized clock protein oscillations in subsets of central clock neurons. Extracellular leg nerve recordings reveal temperature- and IR25a-dependent sensory responses, and IR25a misexpression confers temperature-dependent firing of heterologous neurons. We propose that IR25a is part of an input pathway to the circadian clock that detects small temperature differences. This pathway operates in the absence of known ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ sensors in the Drosophila antenna, revealing the existence of novel periphery-to-brain temperature signalling channels.},

	abstract = {In extreme high-latitude marine environments that are without solar illumination in winter, light-mediated patterns of biological migration have historically been considered non-existent [ 1 ]. However, diel vertical migration (DVM) of zooplankton has been shown to occur even during the darkest part of the polar night, when illumination levels are exceptionally low [ 2, 3 ]. This paradox is, as yet, unexplained. Here, we present evidence of an unexpected uniform behavior across the entire Arctic, in fjord, shelf, slope and open sea, where vertical migrations of zooplankton are driven by lunar illumination. A shift from solar-day (24-hr period) to lunar-day (24.8-hr period) vertical migration takes place in winter when the moon rises above the horizon. Further, mass sinking of zooplankton from the surface waters and accumulation at a depth of ∼50 m occurs every 29.5 days in winter, coincident with the periods of full moon. Moonlight may enable predation of zooplankton by carnivorous zooplankters, fish, and birds now known to feed during the polar night [ 4 ]. Although primary production is almost nil at this time, lunar vertical migration (LVM) may facilitate monthly pulses of carbon remineralization, as they occur continuously in illuminated mesopelagic systems [ 5 ], due to community respiration of carnivorous and detritivorous zooplankton. The extent of LVM during the winter suggests that the behavior is highly conserved and adaptive and therefore needs to be considered as “baseline” zooplankton activity in a changing Arctic ocean [ 6–9 ].,},

Herein, we investigated the function of two phosphorylation sites at Ser826 and Ser828 located in a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) on the Drosophila melanogaster PER protein. These sites are phosphorylated by DOUBLETIME (DBT; Drosophila homolog of CK1δ/ϵ), the key circadian kinase regulating the daily changes in PER stability and phosphorylation. Mutant flies where phosphorylation at Ser826/Ser828 is blocked manifest behavioral rhythms with periods slightly longer then 1 hour and altered temperature compensation properties. Intriguingly, although phosphorylation at these sites does not influence PER stability, timing of nuclear entry or transcriptional autoinhibition, the phospho-occupancy at Ser826/Ser828 is rapidly stimulated by light and blocked by TIMELESS (TIM), the major photosensitive clock component in Drosophila and a crucial binding partner of PER. Our findings identify the first phosphorylation sites on core clock proteins that are acutely regulated by photic cues and suggest that some phospho-sites on PER proteins can modulate the pace of downstream behavioral rhythms without altering central aspects of the clock mechanism.},

The objectives of the study were to assess how variations in physical characteristics across fjord systems affect the distribution and abundance of euphausiids and amphipods and the potential for these macrozooplankton species to reproduce in these waters. The abundances of euphausiids and amphipods were higher in Kongsfjorden than in Rijpfjorden and Isfjorden, and the highest abundances were observed at the innermost stations of Kongsfjorden, where Thysanoessa inermis and Themisto libellula dominated. The Atlantic species Thysanoessa longicaudata, Meganyctiphanes norvegica and Themisto abyssorum dominated at the outside Kongsfjorden. Inter-annual and seasonal variability in abundances of euphausiids and amphipods were evident. The presence of ripe euphausiids outside Kongsfjorden indicates that they may reproduce in these areas. Mature individuals of T. abyssorum were recorded mainly outside Kongsfjorden, whereas no mature or ripe T. libellula were present in both the inner and outer parts of this fjord. If the warming trend persists, as seen during the last decade, this would favour the Atlantic/boreal euphausiid species, while Arctic species, such as the amphipod T. libellula, may decline. Euphausiids and amphipods are major food of capelin (Mallotus villosus) and polar cod (Boreogadus saida), respectively, in this region, and changes in prey abundance will likely have an impact on the feeding dynamics of these important fish species.},

	abstract = {The southwestern Norwegian Sea is characterized by an inflow of warm and saline Atlantic water from the southwest and cold and less saline East Icelandic Water (EIW), of Arctic origin, from the northwest. These two water masses meet and form the Iceland-Faroe Front (IFF). In this region, the copepod Calanus finmarchicus plays a key role in the pelagic ecosystem. Time-series of C. finmarchicus and Calanus hyperboreus in May and September, extending back to the early 1990s, were studied in relation to phytoplankton bloom dynamics and hydrography. The main reproductive period of C. finmarchicus started consistently earlier south of the IFF, resulting in different life cycles and stage compositions in the two water masses. In 2003, a sudden shift occurred north of the IFF, resulting in a similar phenology pattern to south of the IFF. Before this, only one generation of C. finmarchicus was produced in the Arctic water, but the earlier reproduction enabled the species to produce two generations after 2003. Simultaneously, C. hyperboreus, an expatriate in the EIW, largely disappeared. Food availability is unlikely the reason for the phenological differences observed across the front, as the typical pattern of the phytoplankton spring bloom showed an earlier onset north of the IFF. Temperature and salinity peaked at record high values in 2003 and 2004, and therefore possible links to oceanography are discussed. The dominant role of Calanus spp. and the potential linkages to water mass exchanges may herald strong effects on the ecosystem and pelagic fish in this subpolar Atlantic region under expected climate change.},

Any change in the abundance and distribution of C. finmarchicus would have profound effects on North Atlantic pelagic ecosystems and the services that they support, particularly on the coastal shelves located at the southern margins of the species' range. We tested the hypothesis that the physiological rates and processes of C. finmarchicus, determining its vital rates, are unaffected by increases in CO2 concentration predicted to occur in the surface waters of the ocean during the next 100 years. We reared C. finmarchicus from eggs to adults at a control (580 µatm, the ambient concentration at the laboratory's seawater intake) and at predicted mid-range (1200 µatm) and high (1900 µatm) pCO2. There was no significant effect of pCO2 on development times, lipid accumulation, feeding rate, or metabolic rate. Small but significant treatment effects were found in body length and mass (in terms of dry, carbon and nitrogen mass), notably a somewhat larger body size at the mid-pCO2 treatment; that is, a putatively beneficial effect. Based on these results, and a review of other studies of Calanus, we conclude that the present parameterizations of vital rates in models of C. finmarchicus population dynamics, used to generate scenarios of abundance and distribution of this species under future conditions, do not require an “ocean acidification effect” adjustment. A review of research on planktonic copepods indicates that, with only a few exceptions, impacts of increased CO2 are small at the levels predicted to occur during the next century.},

	abstract = {Summary
In the core mammalian circadian negative feedback loop, the BMAL1-CLOCK complex activates the transcription of the genes Period (Per) and Cryptochrome (Cry). To close the negative feedback loop, the PER-CRY complex interacts with the BMAL1-CLOCK complex to repress its activity. These two processes are separated temporally to ensure clock function. Here, we show that histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is a critical component of the circadian negative feedback loop by regulating both the activation and repression processes in a deacetylase activity-independent manner. Genetic depletion of Hdac3 results in low-amplitude circadian rhythms and dampened E-box-driven transcription. In subjective morning, HDAC3 is required for the efficient transcriptional activation process by regulating BMAL1 stability. In subjective night, however, HDAC3 blocks FBXL3-mediated CRY1 degradation and strongly promotes BMAL1 and CRY1 association. Therefore, these two opposing but temporally separated roles of HDAC3 in the negative feedback loop provide a mechanism for robust circadian gene expression.},

	abstract = {Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are a key species in Southern Ocean ecosystems, maintaining very large numbers of predators, and fluctuations in their abundance can affect the overall structure and functioning of the ecosystems. The interannual variability in the abundance and biomass of krill was examined using a 17-year time-series of acoustic observations undertaken in the Western Core Box (WCB) survey area to the northwest of South Georgia, Southern Ocean. Krill targets were identified in acoustic data using a multifrequency identification window and converted to krill density using the Stochastic Distorted-Wave Born Approximation target strength model. Krill density ranged over several orders of magnitude (0–10 000 g m−2) and its distribution was highly skewed with many zero observations. Within each survey, the mean krill density was significantly correlated with the top 7\% of the maximum krill densities observed. Hence, only the densest krill swarms detected in any one year drove the mean krill density estimates for the WCB in that year. WCB krill density (µ, mean density for the area) showed several years (1997/1998, 2001–2003, 2005–2007) of high values (µ {\textgreater} 30 g m−2) interspersed with years (1999/2000, 2004, 2009/2010) of low density (µ {\textless} 30 g m−2). This pattern showed three different periods, with fluctuations every 4–5 years. Cross correlation analyses of variability in krill density with current and lagged indices of ocean (sea surface temperature, SST and El Niño/Southern Oscillation) and atmospheric variability (Southern Annular Mode) found the highest correlation between krill density and winter SST (August SST) from the preceding year. A quadratic regression (r2 = 0.42, p {\textless} 0.05) provides a potentially valuable index for forecasting change in this ecosystem.},

This is a region characterized by late spring–summer diatom blooms, moderately high seasonal primary productivity (50–150 mmol C m−2 d−1 in December–February), and high phytoplankton and krill biomass in the seasonal sea-ice zone. The mass flux ranged from near 0 to over 1 g m−2 d−1 and was near 0\% to \&gt;30\% organic carbon (mean 8\%). Sedimentation from the upper ocean as estimated by the trap collections at 170 m exhibited strong seasonality with high fluxes (1–10 mmol C m−2 d−1) in November–March following ice retreat and very low fluxes (\&lt;0.001 mmol C m−2 d−1) during the Austral winter and under sea-ice cover. An average of 85\% of the annual export of 212 mmol C m−2 occurred during the seasonal peak flux episodes. Over the trap record, the annual peak flux episode has tended to occur later in the Austral summer, advancing by about 40 days since 1993. The time-integrated sedimentation during the peak flux episode was \&lt;1–50\% of the SeaWiFS-estimated primary production (mean 4\%) at the trap site over the period 1998–2006. The elemental composition of material captured in the traps had an average C:N:P of 212:25:1, greater than the canonical Redfield values. High C:P ratios (400–600) corresponded with the annual flux peak, indicating preferential loss of P from the sinking particles in the summer, ice-free period. The composition of the exported material more closely approximated the Redfield composition during the low-flux, winter period.},

To meet the changing expectations of scientists collecting data and of data reuse by others, collaborative strategies involving diverse teams of information professionals are developing. These changes are stimulating the growth of information infrastructures that support multi-scale sampling, data repositories, and data integration. Two examples of oceanographic projects incorporating data management in partnership with science programs are discussed: the Palmer Station Long-Term Ecological Research program (Palmer LTER) and the United States Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (US JGOFS). Lessons learned from a decade of data management within these communities provide an experience base from which to develop information management strategies—short-term and long-term. Ocean Informatics provides one example of a conceptual framework for managing the complexities inherent to sharing oceanographic data. Elements are introduced that address the economies-of-scale and the complexities-of-scale pertinent to a broader vision of information management and scientific research.},

In this paper we use quasi-weekly hydrographic profiles and moored records of temperature, salinity and water velocity to investigate the nature of internal tides and coastal upwelling behaviour in northern Marguerite Bay at the western Antarctic Peninsula. Within Ryder Bay, a near-coastal site in northern Marguerite Bay, atmospherically forced oscillations of the water column with periods around 2–7 days are observed, associated with wind-induced coastal upwelling and downwelling. Sea-ice cover is seen to play a role in the seasonal suppression of these oscillations. Significant internal tides also are observed at this site. A range of processes are seen to be important in controlling internal tide variability, including changes in local stratification and sea-ice conditions. Both diurnal and semidiurnal internal tidal species are observed, despite the study region being poleward of the critical latitude for diurnal internal tides. This suggests that at least the diurnal internal tides are generated close to the study location, and we investigate likely sources.},

Information on krill condition during winter and early spring is slowly evolving with our enhanced ability to sample at this time of year. However, because of the limited spatial and temporal data, our understanding of fundamental biological parameters for krill during winter is limited. Our study assessed the condition of larval (furcilia VI) and one year old juvenile krill collected in East Antarctica (115°E −130°E and 64°S − 66°S) from September to October 2012. Krill condition was assessed using morphometric, elemental and biochemical body composition, growth rates, oxygen uptake and lipid content and composition. Diet was assessed using fatty acid biomarkers analysed in the krill. The growth rate of larvae was 0.0038 mm day with an inter moult period of 14 days. The average oxygen uptake of juvenile krill was 0.30±0.02 μl oxygen consumed per mg dry weight per hour. Although protein was not significantly different amongst the krill analysed, the lipid content of krill was highly variable ranging from 9\% to 27\% dry weight in juveniles and from 4\% to 13\% dry weight in larvae. Specific algal biomarkers, fatty acids ratios, levels of both long-chain (≥C20) monounsaturated fatty acids and bacterial fatty acids found in krill were indicative of the mixed nature of dietary sources and the opportunistic feeding capability of larval and juvenile krill at the end of winter.},

	abstract = {The kinetics of food processing by zooplankton affects both their energy budgets and the biogeochemical fate of their fecal pellets. We sampled 40 schools of krill across the Scotia Sea during spring, summer and autumn and found that in all 3 seasons, every aspect of their absorption and defecation varied greatly. The C content of fecal pellets varied from 0.85\% to 29\% of their dry mass (median 9.8\%) and C egestion rates varied 75-fold. C:N mass ratios of pellets ranged from 4.9 to 13.2 (median 7.8), higher than values of 3.9 in the krill and 5.4 in their food, pointing to enhanced uptake of N. Pellet sinking rates equated to 27–1218 m d−1 (median 304 m d−1), being governed mainly by pellet diameter (80–600 μm, mean 183 μm) and density (1.038–1.391 g cm−3, mean 1.121 g cm−3). Pellets showed little loss of C or N in filtered seawater over the first 2 days and were physically robust. When feeding rates were low, slow gut passage time and high absorption efficiency resulted in low egestion rates of pellets that were low in C and N content. These pellets were compact, dense and fast-sinking. Conversely, in good feeding conditions much food tended to pass quickly through the gut and was not efficiently absorbed, producing C and N-rich, slow-sinking pellets. Such “superfluous feeding” probably maximises the absolute rates of nutrient absorption. Food composition was also important: diatom-rich diets depressed the C content of the pellets but increased their sinking rates, likely due to silica ballasting. So depending on how krill process food, their pellets could represent both vehicles for rapid export and slow sinking, C and N-rich food sources for pelagic scavengers. C egestion rates by krill averaged 3.4\% of summer primary production (and ingestion rates would be 2–10-fold higher than this) so whatever the fate of the pellets, krill are an important re-packager within the food web. While salp pellets tend to sink faster than those of krill, it is the latter that tend to prevail in sediment traps. We suggest that this is because krill schools are more compact, producing “rain showers” of pellets that exceed the capacity of pelagic scavengers to reprocess them.},

	abstract = {The biomass of zooplankton communities in Arctic shelf regions is dominated by the calanoid copepod Calanus glacialis. This species spends the winter in deep water, and then, metabolic rates are low. In late winter, it migrates to the surface where the spring generation develops. To date, it is not fully understood what regulates the activity of the copepods and how it coincides with food availability. To fill this gap, we sampled C. glacialis, mainly copepodite stage V, in a high-Arctic fjord in monthly intervals for 1 year and determined proteinase and lipase/esterase activities in relation to food availability and depth distribution of the copepods. By substrate SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), we tackled changes in specific isoforms. We found a clear seasonal enzyme activity pattern. Activities in winter were reduced by at least 75 \% as compared to spring. Substrate SDS-PAGE showed high heterogeneity of lipolytic enzymes, which could reflect extensive accumulation and metabolization of internal lipids. Only one band of proteolytic activity was found, and it intensified with the onset of the algal blooms. In late winter/spring, we sampled females and CIV, which also showed high digestive enzyme activities in surface water and low activities in deep water. High enzyme activities were related to the ice algal and phytoplankton blooms in spring. In autumn, the copepods descended although food was still available. C. glacialis could thus benefit from an early ice breakup and early algal blooms, but not from long-lasting phytoplankton availability.},

It is the major contributor to zooplankton biomass, a predominant grazer, and an important prey for seabirds, and fish. As for a planktonic species, its dispersal is expected to be widespread and mediated by ocean currents. However, complex circulation patterns and the existence of semi-enclosed fjords and seas in the Arctic can be hypothesized to influence the population genetic structure of this species. In this study, we aimed to infer patterns of connectivity between populations of C. glacialis distributed around the Arctic and across putative barriers formed by oceanographic currents and semi-enclosed fjords and seas. To achieve this, we used 11 polymorphic microsatellite loci to genotype 189 individuals from 7 locations: Svalbard fjords (Kongsfjorden, Hornsund, Isfjorden, Rijpfjorden, and Storfjorden), White Sea, and Amundsen Gulf, thus providing greater genetic resolution over a larger biogeographical scale than in previous studies. The results revealed a lack of structure among all seven locations around the Arctic, indicating a panmictic population with large-scale gene flow. This study also supports the hypothesis that the planktonic fauna of the White Sea is not isolated from that of the other Arctic regions.},

	abstract = {We apply a coupled biophysical model to reconstruct the environmental history of larval radiated shanny in Conception Bay, Newfoundland. Data on the larvae, their prey and predators were collected during a 2-week period. Our goal was to determine whether environmentally explicit information could be used to infer the characteristics of individual larvae that are most likely to survive. Backward drift reconstruction was used to assess the influence of variations in the feeding environment on changes in the growth rates of individual larvae. Forward drift projections were used to assess the impact of predators on mortality rates as well as the cumulative density distribution of growth rates in the population of larvae in different areas of the bay. There was relatively little influence of current feeding conditions on increment widths. Patterns of selective mortality indicate that fast-growing individuals suffered higher mortality rates, suggesting they were growing into a predator's prey field. However, the mortality rates appeared to increase with decreasing predator abundance, based on the drift reconstructions. The relationship of growth and mortality with environmental conditions suggests that short-term, small-scale variations in environmental history may be difficult to describe accurately in this relatively small system (∼1000 km2).},

It is thought that diving predators optimize their foraging success when oxygen use and energy gain act as competing currencies, but this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested because it has been difficult to measure the quality of prey that is targeted by free-ranging animals. We used high-resolution multisensor digital tags attached to foraging blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) with concurrent acoustic prey measurements to quantify foraging performance across depth and prey density gradients. We parameterized two competing physiological models to estimate energy gain and expenditure based on foraging decisions. Our analyses show that at low prey densities, blue whale feeding rates and energy intake were low to minimize oxygen use, but at higher prey densities feeding frequency increased to maximize energy intake. Contrary to previous paradigms, we demonstrate that blue whales are not indiscriminate grazers but instead switch foraging strategies in response to variation in prey density and depth to maximize energetic efficiency.
The world’s largest predators, blue whales, switch strategies to maximize foraging efficiency as a function of prey density and depth.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: The copepod Calanus finmarchicus is widely distributed over the sub-polar Atlantic and dominates the mesozooplanktonic biomass in that region. Despite this, all previous C. finmarchicus population modelling studies have been spatially and temporally limited. In this paper we present results from a fully stage-resolved model in a domain spanning the entire geographic range of the species (30 to 80°N and 80°W to 90°E. The model was driven by temperature and transport from the Ocean Circulation and Climate Advanced Modelling project (OCCAM) and phytoplankton food derived from satellite (SeaWiFS) sea-surface colour observations. The resulting quasi-stationary yearly cycle was assessed against seasonally resolved maps of continuous plankton recorder observations, winter cruise data on the distribution of diapausers, and time series from locations distributed over the North Atlantic. The model’s high computational efficiency permitted its free parameters to be selected to yield a good correspondence with the field data. We were also able to explore the effects of changing the assumptions regarding diapause and mortality. By falsifying alternative models we conclude that (1) a fixed fraction of each surface generation enters diapause, (2) overwintering individuals enter diapause at the end of the fifth copepodite stage, and (3) mortality is an increasing function of temperature. Finally, we demonstrate that the demographic impact of transport is limited, except in shelf seas and at the edges of the distribution; nevertheless, there is a very high level of population connectivity over the whole domain.},

	abstract = {The iron-limited Southern Ocean plays an important role in regulating atmospheric CO2 levels. Marine mammal respiration has been proposed to decrease the efficiency of the Southern Ocean biological pump by returning photosynthetically fixed carbon to the atmosphere. Here, we show that by consuming prey at depth and defecating iron-rich liquid faeces into the photic zone, sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) instead stimulate new primary production and carbon export to the deep ocean. We estimate that Southern Ocean sperm whales defecate 50 tonnes of iron into the photic zone each year. Molar ratios of Cexport ∶Feadded determined during natural ocean fertilization events are used to estimate the amount of carbon exported to the deep ocean in response to the iron defecated by sperm whales. We find that Southern Ocean sperm whales stimulate the export of 4 × 105 tonnes of carbon per year to the deep ocean and respire only 2 × 105 tonnes of carbon per year. By enhancing new primary production, the populations of 12 000 sperm whales in the Southern Ocean act as a carbon sink, removing 2 × 105 tonnes more carbon from the atmosphere than they add during respiration. The ability of the Southern Ocean to act as a carbon sink may have been diminished by large-scale removal of sperm whales during industrial whaling.},

Sinking of detrital material (“biological pump”) is usually thought to be the main biological component of this flux. Here, we identify an additional biological mechanism, the seasonal “lipid pump,” which is highly efficient at sequestering carbon into the deep ocean. It involves the vertical transport and metabolism of carbon rich lipids by overwintering zooplankton. We show that one species, the copepod Calanus finmarchicus overwintering in the North Atlantic, sequesters an amount of carbon equivalent to the sinking flux of detrital material. The efficiency of the lipid pump derives from a near-complete decoupling between nutrient and carbon cycling—a “lipid shunt,” and its direct transport of carbon through the mesopelagic zone to below the permanent thermocline with very little attenuation. Inclusion of the lipid pump almost doubles the previous estimates of deep-ocean carbon sequestration by biological processes in the North Atlantic.},

The SOI continental shelf ({\textasciitilde}44 000 km2), was less than half covered by grounded ice sheet during glaciations, is biologically rich and a key area of both sea surface warming and sea-ice losses. Little was known of the carbon cycle there, but recent work showed it was a very important site of carbon immobilization (net annual carbon accumulation) by benthos, one of the few demonstrable negative feedbacks to climate change. Carbon immobilization by SOI bryozoans was higher, per species, unit area and ice-free day, than anywhere-else polar. Here, we investigate why carbon immobilization has been so high at SOI, and whether this is due to high density, longevity or high annual production in six study species of bryozoans (benthic suspension feeders). We compared benthic carbon immobilization across major regions around West Antarctica with sea-ice and primary production, from remotely sensed and directly sampled sources. Lowest carbon immobilization was at the northernmost study regions (South Georgia) and southernmost Amundsen Sea. However, data standardized for age and density showed that only SOI was anomalous (high). High immobilization at SOI was due to very high annual production of bryozoans (rather than high densities or longevity), which were 2x, 3x and 5x higher than on the Bellingshausen, South Georgia and Amundsen shelves, respectively. We found that carbon immobilization correlated to the duration (but not peak or integrated biomass) of phytoplankton blooms, both in directly sampled, local scale data and across regions using remote-sensed data. The long bloom at SOI seems to drive considerable carbon immobilization, but sea-ice losses across West Antarctica mean that significant carbon sinks and negative feedbacks to climate change could also develop in the Bellingshausen and Amundsen seas.},

These behaviors are driven by interactions within and between species, environmental conditions, and the biology of the species involved. Although extensive theoretical work has explored predator–prey dynamics, these models have not considered the impact of behavioral plasticity and life-history trade-offs on predicted patterns. We apply a modeling method that allows the consideration of a spatial, dynamic ecological game between predators and prey using a life-history perspective. As an illustrative example, we model the habitat selection of Antarctic krill and penguins during the time when penguins are land-based for reproduction. Although environmental conditions and the life-history constraints of each species have both direct and indirect effects on both species, the penguin's foraging rule (whether food-maximizing or time-minimizing) has the greatest effect on the qualitative distribution pattern of both species. Size-dependent diel vertical migration of krill also strongly affects penguin foraging patterns. This model generates suggestions for future research and qualitative predictions that can be tested in the field. The application of this method to a specific problem also demonstrates its ability to increase our understanding of important ecological interactions in general. Corresponding Editor: G. E.

The smallest areas ({\textless}1\% area of the SO) are affected by glacier retreat and warming in the deeper euphotic layer. In the future, decrease in the sea-ice is expected to be widespread. Changes in iceberg impact resulting from further collapse of ice-shelves can potentially affect large parts of shelf and ephemerally in the off-shore regions.

	abstract = {In this paper, we report on a coupled physical–biological model describing the spatio-temporal distribution of Calanus finmarchicus over an area of the North Atlantic and Norwegian Sea from 56°N, 30°W to 72°N, 20°E. The model, which explicitly represents all the life-history stages, is implemented in a highly efficient discrete space–time format which permits wide-ranging dynamic exploration and parameter optimization. The underlying hydrodynamic driving functions come from the Hamburg Shelf-Ocean Model (HAMSOM). The spatio-temporal distribution of resources powering development and reproduction is inferred from SeaWiFS sea-surface colour observations. We confront the model with distributional data inferred from continuous plankton recorder observations, overwintering distribution data from a variety of EU, UK national and Canadian programmes which were collated as part of the Trans-Atlantic Study of Calanus (TASC) programme, and high-frequency stage-resolved point time-series obtained as part of the TASC programme. We test two competing hypotheses concerning the control of awakening from diapause and conclude that only a mechanism with characteristics similar to photoperiodic control can explain the test data.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: The Palmer Long Term Ecological Research study region west of the Antarctic Peninsula is experiencing warming and changing seasonal sea ice dynamics. Abundance patterns of 3 species of pelagic secondary producers were analyzed for trends, cycles, range extensions or shifts in the location of highest density, and for changes in population dynamics over a 16 yr period (1993-2008). Species analyzed represented different hydrographic regimes and are known to have contrasting responses to seasonal sea ice dynamics: krill Euphausia superba, seasonal sea ice zone; tunicates Salpa thompsoni, warmer waters with minimal sea ice; and larval Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum, cold continental shelf waters. Cycles were observed in grid-wide abundance and recruitment for E. superba. Maximum grid-wide densities did not decrease, but the location of highest densities shifted southward 200 km, away from Adélie penguin rookeries at the northern end. A distinct change post-1999 was apparent in the frequency of occurrence and abundance of S. thompsoni. Mixtures of krill and salps became common, but neither peak densities nor the frequency of peak years for salps increased. As with Antarctic krill, highest salp densities shifted southward alongshore. Larval P. antarcticum were abundant in the northern coastal region in the early 1990s, but virtually disappeared in that region after 1999/2000. Possible mechanisms underlying these observations include the southerly movement of the sea ice edge during spring, changes in proximity of source populations (salps), and changes in transport pathways (larval P. antarcticum). Patterns are compared to those in the SW Atlantic.},

Nutrient supply is governed by a range of physical, chemical and biological processes, and there are significant feedbacks within the ecosystem. It has been suggested that baleen whales form a crucial part of biogeochemical cycling processes through the consumption of nutrient-rich krill and subsequent defecation, but data on their contribution are scarce. We analysed the concentration of iron, cadmium, manganese, cobalt, copper, zinc, phosphorus and carbon in baleen whale faeces and muscle, and krill tissue using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Metal concentrations in krill tissue were between 20 thousand and 4.8 million times higher than typical Southern Ocean HNLC seawater concentrations, while whale faecal matter was between 276 thousand and 10 million times higher. These findings suggest that krill act as a mechanism for concentrating and retaining elements in the surface layer, which are subsequently released back into the ocean, once eaten by whales, through defecation. Trace metal to carbon ratios were also higher in whale faeces compared to whale muscle indicating that whales are concentrating carbon and actively defecating trace elements. Consequently, recovery of the great whales may facilitate the recycling of nutrients via defecation, which may affect productivity in HNLC areas.},

Antarctica has been mostly covered by ice since the inception of large-scale continental glaciation during the Oligocene, which profoundly altered the isotopic and mineralogical records of the sediments surrounding the continent. Houben et al. (p. 341) found records of the corresponding living systems in the fossil marine dinoflagellate cysts, which revealed that a microplankton ecosystem, similar to the one that exists today, appeared simultaneously with the first major Antarctic glaciation approximately 34 million years ago.
The circum-Antarctic Southern Ocean is an important region for global marine food webs and carbon cycling because of sea-ice formation and its unique plankton ecosystem. However, the mechanisms underlying the installation of this distinct ecosystem and the geological timing of its development remain unknown. Here, we show, on the basis of fossil marine dinoflagellate cyst records, that a major restructuring of the Southern Ocean plankton ecosystem occurred abruptly and concomitant with the first major Antarctic glaciation in the earliest Oligocene ({\textasciitilde}33.6 million years ago). This turnover marks a regime shift in zooplankton-phytoplankton interactions and community structure, which indicates the appearance of eutrophic and seasonally productive environments on the Antarctic margin. We conclude that earliest Oligocene cooling, ice-sheet expansion, and subsequent sea-ice formation were important drivers of biotic evolution in the Southern Ocean.
The Southern Ocean plankton ecosystem underwent an abrupt and profound reorganization in the earliest Oligocene.

	abstract = {A major mid-1980s shift in ecological structure of significant portions of the Southern Ocean was partially due to the serial depletion of fish by intensive industrial fishing, rather than solely to climate factors as previously hypothesized. Over a brief period (1969–1973), several finfish stocks were on average reduced to {\textless}50\%, and finally (mid-1980s) to {\textless}20\%, of original size. Despite management actions, few stocks have recovered and some are still declining. Most affected species exhibit K-selected life-history patterns, and before exploitation presumably fluctuated in accordance with infrequent strong year classes, as is true of such fish elsewhere. A climate regime, the Southern Annular Mode, once oscillated between two states, but has remained in its ‘positive mode’ since the time of the fish extraction. This may have increased finfish vulnerability to exploitation. As breeding stocks decreased, we hypothesize that availability of annually produced juvenile fish fed upon by upper-level predators remained low. Correlations between predator populations and fish biomass in predator foraging areas indicate that southern elephant seal Mirounga leonina, Antarctic fur seal Arctocephalus gazella, gentoo penguin Pygoscelis papua, macaroni penguin Eudyptes chrysolphus and ‘imperial’ shag Phalacrocorax spp. – all feeding extensively on these fish, and monitored at Marion, Crozet, Kerguelen, Heard, South Georgia, South Orkney and South Shetland Islands, where fishing was concentrated – declined simultaneously during the two periods of heavy fishing. These patterns indicate the past importance of demersal fish as prey in Antarctic marine systems, but determining these interactions’ ecological mechanisms may now be impossible.},

	abstract = {The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) is widely recognized as a leading international organization in developing best practice in the ecosystem approach to managing fisheries. CCAMLR provides a useful case study for examining the impediments to implementing ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) because it has EBFM principles embedded within its convention rather than having to make a transition from single-species management to an ecosystem approach. CCAMLR is demonstrating that (i) EBFM does not need to equate to complexity in management and (ii) methods can be developed to decide on spatial management strategies for fisheries so that predators of target species are not disproportionately affected as a result of spatial and/or temporal dependencies of predators on their prey. Science has an important role in implementing EBFM, not only in measuring and assessing the status of target species and their predators but also in designing cost-effective management strategies and in resolving disputes. Importantly, attention needs to be given to developing the capability and tools to overcome differences amongst scientists in providing advice to managers. The CCAMLR experience suggests that, without adequate safeguards, voluntary participation by fishing States in CCAMLR and its consensus environment do not provide strong foundations for achieving, in the long term, the ecosystem-based principles for managing fisheries when there is any degree of scientific uncertainty. Some solutions to these issues are discussed. Overall, broader-than-CCAMLR solutions amongst the international community as well as the continued commitment of CCAMLR Members will be required to resolve these issues.},

These examples also display the traits of mobile aggregations and dietary diversity, which help to reduce the foraging footprint from their large, localised biomasses. This suggests that top-down control on their food operates at local aggregation scales and not at wider scales suggested by the original definition of wasp-waist. With this modification, the wasp-waist framework can cross-fertilise marine and terrestrial approaches, revealing how seemingly disparate but economically important systems operate.},

The porous nature of sea ice allows vertical fluid exchange within the ice and across the ice-water interface in much the same way as the sediment-water interface. The present paper reports on experiments examining the effect of irregular undersides of sea ice on the variability of algal biomass, using flume tanks with constant unidirectional flow. Bulges and depressions at the ice-water interface altered the interfacial pore water flux and affected the spatial distribution and abundance of ice-associated algae substantially. Dye tracer experiments demonstrated that interfacial water fluxes around ice bulges are by a factor of 10–100 higher than published indirect estimates based on algal nutrient demands in flat fast ice. Further, underside relief structures migrated downstream, illustrating their dynamic and transient nature. The presence of a relief fostered algal accumulation compared to a flat underside. Algal growth occurred at bulge sites facing the current, while particles accumulated in the wake further downstream. We infer from our experiments that sea ice is not only a source for algae production, but can also serve as sink for organic material from the water column. We propose that local formation and ablation of ice around underside features is an important process which induces high variations in the sea-ice habitat structure and in growth of sympagic organisms, and could partially explain the high natural variability observed in the abundance and colonization patterns of sea-ice organisms.},

However, the influence of giant icebergs, over 18 km in length, on marine primary production in the Southern Ocean is less well studied. Here we present an analysis of 175 satellite images of open ocean colour before and after the passage of 17 giant icebergs between 2003 and 2013. We detect substantially enhanced chlorophyll levels, typically over a radius of at least 4–10 times the iceberg’s length, that can persist for more than a month following passage of a giant iceberg. This area of influence is more than an order of magnitude larger than that found for sub-kilometre scale icebergs or in ship-based surveys of giant icebergs. Assuming that carbon export increases by a factor of 5–10 over the area of influence, we estimate that up to a fifth of the Southern Ocean’s downward carbon flux originates with giant iceberg fertilization. We suggest that, if giant iceberg calving increases this century as expected, this negative feedback on the carbon cycle may become more important.},

However, the mechanisms responsible for the release of the deeply sequestered carbon to the atmosphere at deglaciation, and the relative importance of deep ocean sequestration in regulating millennial-timescale variations in atmospheric CO2 concentration before the Last Glacial Maximum, have remained unclear. Here we present sedimentary redox-sensitive trace-metal records from the Antarctic Zone of the Southern Ocean that provide a reconstruction of transient changes in deep ocean oxygenation and, by inference, respired carbon storage throughout the last glacial cycle. Our data suggest that respired carbon was removed from the abyssal Southern Ocean during the Northern Hemisphere cold phases of the deglaciation, when atmospheric CO2 concentration increased rapidly, reflecting—at least in part—a combination of dwindling iron fertilization by dust and enhanced deep ocean ventilation. Furthermore, our records show that the observed covariation between atmospheric CO2 concentration and abyssal Southern Ocean oxygenation was maintained throughout most of the past 80,000 years. This suggests that on millennial timescales deep ocean circulation and iron fertilization in the Southern Ocean played a consistent role in modifying atmospheric CO2 concentration.},

	abstract = {The Drosophila clock relies on transcriptional feedback loops that generate daily oscillations of the clock gene expression at mRNA and protein levels. In the evening, the CLOCK (CLK) and CYCLE (CYC) basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) PAS-domain transcription factors activate the expression of the period (per) and timeless (tim) genes. Posttranslational modifications delay the accumulation of PER and TIM, which inhibit CLK/CYC activity in the late night. We show here that a null mutant of the clockwork orange (cwo) gene encoding a bHLH orange-domain putative transcription factor displays long-period activity rhythms. cwo loss of function increases cwo mRNA levels but reduces mRNA peak levels of the 4 described CLK/CYC targets, inducing an almost complete loss of their cycling. In addition, the absence of CWO induces alterations of PER and CLK phosphorylation cycles. Our results indicate that, in vivo, CWO modulates clock gene expression through both repressor and activator transcriptional functions.},

Robust nonparametric methods are available but are limited to specific wave forms. We present RAIN, a robust nonparametric method for the detection of rhythms of prespecified periods in biological data that can detect arbitrary wave forms. When applied to measurements of the circadian transcriptome and proteome of mouse liver, the sets of transcripts and proteins with rhythmic abundances were significantly expanded due to the increased detection power, when we controlled for false discovery. Validation against independent data confirmed the quality of these results. The large expansion of the circadian mouse liver transcriptomes and proteomes reflected the prevalence of nonsymmetric wave forms and led to new conclusions about function.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Antarctic phytoplankton is characterized by a pronounced seasonality in abundance, driven mainly by changes in sunlight. We combined measurements and modeling to describe the influence of changing daylength on fall and winter phytoplankton production in coastal waters of the western Antarctic Peninsula (wAP) in 2001 and 2002. The model was parameterized with field observations from the Palmer Long-Term Ecological program in the wAP during summer and early fall and from the Southern Ocean Global Ecosystems Dynamics program fall and winter cruises to Marguerite Bay and shelf waters. Shorter daylength and a deepening of the mixed layer account for most of the decrease in primary production during March, April, and May. At this time, biomass decreases by an order of magnitude and remains low and constant until the end of August. An additional loss rate was added to the primary production model to fit output to observations. This loss rate, estimated at {\textasciitilde}0.1 to 0.15 d−1, is due to physical, chemical, and biological processes such as scavenging by sea ice, zooplankton grazing, cell lysis, and cell sedimentation, which are expected to be high at this time of year. Growth and loss rates of phytoplankton populations are similar on 1 March, with growth decreasing rapidly over time while the loss rates remain constant. By the beginning of winter (1 June), growth is low, with minimum rates in July and increasing towards September. During a period of diminishing food supply, preliminary estimates of grazing indicate that fall biomass could support existing macrozooplankton populations, but the timing and concentration of food supply is variable and expected to affect health of zooplankton as they enter the winter.},

	abstract = {The success of any efforts to determine the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems depends on understanding in the first instance the natural variations, which contemporarily occur on the interannual and shorter time scales. Here we present results on the environmental controls of zooplankton distribution patterns and behaviour in the eastern Weddell Sea, Southern Ocean. Zooplankton abundance and vertical migration are derived from the mean volume backscattering strength (MVBS) and the vertical velocity measured by moored acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs), which were deployed simultaneously at 64°S, 66.5°S and 69°S along the Greenwich Meridian from February, 2005, until March, 2008. While these time series span a period of full three years they resolve hourly changes.

A highly persistent behavioural pattern found at all three mooring locations is the synchronous diel vertical migration (DVM) of two distinct groups of zooplankton that migrate between a deep residence depth during daytime and a shallow depth during nighttime. The DVM was closely coupled to the astronomical daylight cycles. However, while the DVM was symmetric around local noon, the annual modulation of the DVM was clearly asymmetric around winter solstice or summer solstice, respectively, at all three mooring sites. DVM at our observation sites persisted throughout winter, even at the highest latitude exposed to the polar night. Since the magnitude as well as the relative rate of change of illumination is minimal at this time, we propose that the ultimate causes of DVM separated from the light-mediated proximal cue that coordinates it. In all three years, a marked change in the migration behaviour occurred in late spring (late October/early November), when DVM ceased. The complete suspension of DVM after early November is possibly caused by the combination of two factors: (1) increased availability of food in the surface mixed layer provided by the phytoplankton spring bloom, and (2) vanishing diurnal enhancement of the threat from visually oriented predators when the illumination is quasi-continuous during the polar and subpolar summer.

Zooplankton abundance in the water column, estimated as the mean MVBS in the depth range 50–300 m, was highest end of summer and lowest mid to end winter on the average annual cycle. However, zooplankton abundance varied several-fold between years and between locations. Based on satellite and in situ data of chlorophyll and sea ice as well as on hydrographic measurements, the interannual and spatial variations of zooplankton mean abundance can be explained by differences in the magnitude of the phytoplankton spring bloom, which develops during the seasonal sea ice retreat. Whereas the vernal ice melt appears necessary to stimulate the blooming of phytoplankton, it is not the determinator of the blooms magnitude, its areal extent and duration. A possible explanation for the limitation of the phytoplankton bloom in some years is top-down control. We hypothesise that the phytoplankton spring development can be curbed by grazing when the zooplankton had attained high abundance by growth during the preceding summer.},

This review focuses on recent advances in the fly visual system, including the discovery of a visual cycle and insights into the machinery involved in generating a light response in photoreceptor cells. These latest findings suggest that the mechanism of light detection in flies and mammals have important parallels. Thus, a better understanding of phototransduction in the fly has the potential to contribute to our understanding of light detection in mammalian ipRGCs.},

	abstract = {CASK (Ca2+/calmodulin-activated serine kinase) is a synaptic protein that interacts with the cytosolic tail of adhesion molecules such as neurexins, syncam and syndecans. It belongs to the MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase) family of scaffolding proteins which are known to decorate cell-cell junctions. CASK is an essential gene in mammals, critical for neurodevelopment. Mutations in the CASK gene in humans result in phenotypes that range from intellectual disability to lethality. Despite its importance, CASK has a single genetic isoform located in the short arm of the X chromosome near an evolutionary breakpoint. Surprisingly, CASK is a non-essential gene in invertebrates and displays functional divergence. In the present article, we describe the phylogenetic differences in existing CASK orthologues. The CASK gene has undergone a huge expansion in size ({\textasciitilde}55-fold). Almost all of this expansion is a direct result of an increase in the size of the introns. The coding region of CASK orthologues, and hence the protein, exhibit a high degree of evolutionary conservation. Within the protein, domain arrangement is completely conserved and substitution rates are higher in the connecting loop regions [L27 (Lin2, Lin7)] than within the domain. Our analyses of single residue substitutions and genotype-phenotype relationships suggest that, other than intronic expansion, the dramatic functional changes of CASK are driven by subtle (non-radical) primary structure changes within the CASK protein and concomitant changes in its protein interactors.},

However, it is not completely understood how the circadian clock regulates L-VGCC current amplitudes without affecting channel gating properties. The phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase–protein kinase B (PI3K–Akt) signaling pathway has been implicated in many vital cellular functions especially in trophic factor-induced ion channel trafficking and membrane insertion. Here, we report that PI3K–Akt signaling participates in the circadian phase-dependent modulation of L-VGCCs. We found that there was a circadian regulation of Akt phosphorylation on Thr308 that peaked at night. Inhibition of PI3K or Akt significantly decreased L-VGCC current amplitudes and the expression of membrane-bound L-VGCCα1D subunit only at night but not during the subjective day. Photoreceptors transfected with a dominant negative Ras had significantly less expression of phosphorylated Akt and L-VGCCα1D subunit compared with non-transfected photoreceptors. Interestingly, both PI3K–Akt and extracellular signal-related kinase were downstream of Ras, and they appeared to be parallel and equally important pathways to regulate L-VGCC rhythms. Inhibition of either pathway abolished the L-VGCC rhythm indicating that there were multiple mechanisms involved in the circadian regulation of L-VGCC rhythms in retina photoreceptors.},

Following Bainbridge \& McKay (1968) and Cushing (1982), a strong link between phytoplankton and fisheries variability is proposed for some fish stocks, like cod and redfish, that spawn in spring in regions where Calanus finmarchicus dominates the plankton. Otherwise, in regions where small copepods and other microzooplankton dominate the prey field productivity for larval fish, a weak link is proposed. Experimental studies, including laboratory observations of copepod reproductive response to food concentration and incubation techniques for measuring in situ reproductive rates, are important for understanding how copepod dynamics may filter year-to-year differences in phytoplankton production cycles.},

Effects of d5-HT1B are synergistic with a mutation in the circadian photoreceptor cryptochrome (CRY) and are mediated by SHAGGY (SGG), Drosophila glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), which phosphorylates TIM. Levels of serotonin are decreased in flies maintained in extended constant darkness, suggesting that modulation of the clock by serotonin may vary under different environmental conditions.

Phylogenetic analyses show at least 2 rounds of gene duplication at the base of the metazoan radiation, as well as several losses, gave rise to 2 cryptochrome (cry) gene families in insects, a Drosophila-like cry1 gene family and a vertebrate-like cry2 family. Previous studies have shown that insect CRY1 is photosensitive, whereas photo-insensitive CRY2 functions to potently inhibit clock-relevant CLOCK:CYCLE-mediated transcription. Here, we extended the transcriptional repressive function of insect CRY2 to 2 orders—Hymenoptera (the honeybee Apis mellifera and the bumblebee Bombus impatiens) and Coleoptera (the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum). Importantly, the bee and beetle CRY2 proteins are not light sensitive in culture, in either degradation of protein levels or inhibitory transcriptional response, suggesting novel light input pathways into their circadian clocks as Apis and Tribolium do not have CRY1. By mapping the functional data onto a cryptochrome/6-4 photolyase gene tree, we find that the transcriptional repressive function of insect CRY2 descended from a light-sensitive photolyase-like ancestral gene, probably lacking the ability to repress CLOCK:CYCLE-mediated transcription.

	abstract = {About 150 clock neurons are clustered in different groups in the brain of Drosophila. Among these clock neurons, some pigment-dispersing factor (PDF)-positive and PDF-negative lateral neurons (LNs) are principal oscillators responsible for bouts of activity in the morning and evening, respectively. The full complement of neurotransmitters in these morning and evening oscillators is not known. By using a screen for candidate neuromediators in clock neurons, we discovered ion transport peptide (ITP) and short neuropeptide F (sNPF) as novel neuropeptides in subpopulations of dorsal (LNds) and ventral (s-LNvs) LNs. Among the six LNds, ITP was found in one that coexpresses long neuropeptide F (NPF) and cryptochrome. We detected sNPF in two LNds that also express cryptochrome; these cells are distinct from three LNds expressing NPF. Thus, we have identified neuropeptides in five of the six LNds. The three LNds expressing cryptochrome, with either ITP or sNPF, are the only ones with additional projections to the accessory medulla. Among the five s-LNvs in the adult brain, ITP was detected in the fifth neuron that is devoid of PDF and sNPF in the four neurons that also express PDF. By using a choline acetyltransferase (Cha) Gal4, we detected Cha expression in the two sNPF producing LNds and in the fifth s-LNv. In the larval brain, two of the four PDF-producing s-LNvs coexpress sNPF. Our findings emphasize that the LNds are heterogeneous both anatomically and with respect to content of neuropeptides, cryptochrome, and other markers and suggest diverse functions of these neurons.

Here we demonstrate that the control of locomotor patterns by this mechanism is primarily light-dependent at low temperatures. At warmer temperatures, when it is vitally important for the fly to avoid midday desiccation, more stringent regulation of splicing is observed, requiring the light input received through the visual system during the day and the circadian clock at night. During the course of this study, we observed that a mutation in the no-receptor-potential-AP41 (norpAP41) gene, which encodes phospholipase-C, generated an extremely high level of 3′ splicing. This cannot be explained simply by the mutation's effect on the visual pathway and suggests that norpAP41 is directly involved in thermosensitivity.},

	abstract = {Many broadcast spawning corals in multiple reef regions release their gametes with incredible temporal precision just once per year, using the lunar cycle to set the night of spawning. Moonlight, rather than tides or other lunar-regulated processes, is thought to be the proximate factor responsible for linking the night of spawning to the phase of the Moon. We compared patterns of gene expression among colonies of the broadcast spawning coral Acropora millepora at different phases of the lunar cycle, and when they were maintained under one of three experimentally simulated lunar lighting treatments: i) lunar lighting conditions matching those on the reef, or lunar patterns mimicking either ii) constant full Moon conditions, or iii) constant new Moon conditions. Normal lunar illumination was found to shift both the level and timing of clock gene transcription cycles between new and full moons, with the peak hour of expression for a number of genes occurring earlier in the evening under a new Moon when compared to a full Moon. When the normal lunar cycle is replaced with nighttime patterns equivalent to either a full Moon or a new Moon every evening, the normal monthlong changes in the level of expression are destroyed for most genes. In combination, these results indicate that daily changes in moonlight that occur over the lunar cycle are essential for maintaining normal lunar periodicity of clock gene transcription, and this may play a role in regulating spawn timing. These data also show that low levels of light pollution may have an impact on coral biological clocks.},

	abstract = {During January and February 2000 four research vessels, from Russia, the UK, Japan, and the United States, conducted an oceanographic survey with 137 hydrographic stations within the Scotia Sea and adjoining waters as part of a survey sponsored by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) to estimate the biomass and distribution of Antarctic krill in the Scotia Sea. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) measurements showed great variability in phytoplankton biomass within the Scotia Sea, with some areas having among the lowest Chl-a concentrations found in Antarctic waters (\&lt;0.1 mg m−3 in surface waters) while other areas were among the richest with \&gt;10 mg m−3. This paper describes the distribution and concentration of Chl-a in the upper 100 m of the water column and relates the Chl-a profiles at individual stations to profiles of upper water-column stability, to the depth of the upper mixed layer, and to the mixing of different water masses. The 58 stations with the lowest Chl-a values in surface waters also had low values for integrated Chl-a (33.9±19.5 mg m−2) and a Chl-a maximum at depths of between 70 and 90 m, in contrast to all other stations where deep Chl-a maxima did not occur. The T/S diagrams at many of these stations were indicative of Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) waters. The central Scotia Sea and areas to the west and north of South Georgia had significantly higher integrated Chl-a values (98.1±46.0 mg m−2, n = 57 ), in addition to five stations with very high Chl-a values (mean of 359±270 mg m−2). The mean rate of integrated primary production, which was estimated using the Chl-a data and the mean incident solar radiation measured from previous cruises as well as from satellite data, was estimated to be 994 mg carbon m−2 day−1. The temperature profiles at these stations suggested that considerable interleaving and mixing of water types had occurred, which was also evident in the T/S diagrams, which indicated mixing of ACC waters with coastal waters originating from Bransfield Strait or the Weddell Sea. There was no significant correlation between integrated Chl-a values and the profiles of upper water column stability or the depth of the upper mixed layer. The spatial variability in phytoplankton biomass within the Scotia Sea is discussed in relation to the hypothesis that low iron concentrations are the major factor controlling phytoplankton biomass in these pelagic Antarctic waters and that concentrations of iron available for phytoplankton uptake are strongly influenced by fronts and the mixing of different water masses.},

	abstract = {The measurement of spatial overlap between predators and fisheries exploiting a common prey source is dependent upon the measurement scale used; inappropriate scales may produce misleading results. Previous assessments of the level of overlap between predators and fisheries for Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) in the region of the South Shetland Islands used different measurement scales and arrived at contradictory conclusions. At-sea data from observations of krill predators during the CCAMLR 2000 Survey were used to identify the areas of potential overlap with fisheries in the Scotia Sea and to determine the scale at which such overlap should be measured. The relationship between autocorrelation and sampling distance was used to identify the characteristic scales of the distribution of predators, krill and krill fisheries, and an effort-corrected index of relative abundance as a function of distance from land was used to identify the characteristics of areas of high potential for overlap. Despite distinct differences in foraging ecology, a group of krill-dependent species including chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica), (Antarctic) fur seal (Arctocephalus sp. (gazella)) and white-chinned petrel (Procellaria aequinoctialis) showed similar patterns of distribution; the relative abundances were highest at 60–120 km from land and decreased sharply at distances greater than 150 km from land. There were more inter-specific differences in the characteristic scales, which were of the order of 50–100 km. Antarctic krill had a characteristic scale of approximately 200 km and the relationship with distance from land showed a log-linear decline. Krill fisheries operate at a scale of 150 km and occur almost entirely within 100 km of land. The requirement of land for breeding and the biological and oceanographic conditions that produce the high concentrations of krill associated with those land areas produce a system in which the demand for Antarctic krill from fisheries and predators is essentially co-extensive. The areas of greatest potential overlap are within 150–200 km of land and to accommodate the scales of operation of the processes involved the extent of such overlap in these areas should be assessed at scales of 70–100 km.},

The areas of highest krill density appeared to move closer to the shelf break as the season progressed.

There were 169 CTD stations to at least 1000 m depth, making this the largest synoptic dataset since 1981. A hydrographic section at Drake Passage was used to define water masses and ocean fronts. In 2000, the Subantarctic Front and the Polar Front were unusually close, and the entire survey occurred to the south of the Polar Front. The survey area was bisected by the Subantarctic Circumpolar Current Front and the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. In Drake Passage, these fronts were widely spaced. A further two hydrographic sections to the east of Drake Passage show that the relative location of these fronts changes east of Drake Passage. Horizontal maps across the survey area show that close to Drake Passage, properties are aligned in a southwest to northeast direction. At approximately 35°W, properties become orientated in a north–south direction. A map of geopotential anomaly shows the flow field across the survey area and allows identification of oceanic fronts. In months previous to the survey, the giant icebergs A22B and B10A crossed the Scotia Sea and closely followed the geopotential field from the CCAMLR 2000 dataset. The SACCF is not the only important front for transporting biological matter from the Antarctic Peninsula to South Georgia; an interaction between the SBACC and the SACCF is also likely to be important.},

	abstract = {Combined sampling and measurement error is estimated for the CCAMLR 2000 acoustic estimate of krill abundance in the Scotia Sea. First, some potential sources of uncertainty in generic echo-integration surveys are reviewed. Then, specific to the CCAMLR 2000 survey, some of the primary sources of measurement error is explored. The error in system calibration is evaluated in relation to the effects of variations in water temperature and salinity on sound speed, sound absorption, and acoustic-beam characteristics. Variation in krill target strength is estimated using a distorted-wave Born approximation model fitted with measured distributions of animal lengths and orientations. The variable effectiveness of two-frequency species classification methods is also investigated using the same scattering model. Most of these components of measurement uncertainty are frequency-dependent and covariant. Ultimately, the total random error in the CCAMLR 2000 acoustic estimate of krill abundance is estimated from a Monte Carlo simulation which assumes independent estimates of krill biomass are derived from acoustic backscatter measurements at three frequencies (38, 120, and 200 kHz). The overall coefficient of variation ( 10.2 ⩽ CV ⩽ 11.6 \% ; 95\% CI) is not significantly different from the sampling variance alone ( CV = 11.4 \% ) . That is, the measurement variance is negligible relative to the sampling variance due to the large number of measurements averaged to derive the ultimate biomass estimate. Some potential sources of bias (e.g., stemming from uncertainties in the target strength model, the krill length-to-weight model, the species classification method, bubble attenuation, signal thresholding, and survey area definition) may be more appreciable components of measurement uncertainty.},

During the CCAMLR 2000 Survey to estimate the biomass and distribution of Antarctic krill, International Whaling Commission observers carried out a visual line transect survey to estimate the number of baleen whales occurring in the survey area. This paper reviews techniques used to estimate krill consumption by baleen whales and in combination with estimates of whale abundance estimates of krill consumption are generated for the South Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. This survey estimates that the present populations of whales feeding in this region are likely to consume approximately 1.6 million tonnes, but possibly up to as much as 2.7 million tonnes of krill within the summer season. Although this only represents 4–6\% of the estimated krill biomass in the region (and probably less than this percentage of the total annual krill production), the depleted numbers of baleen whales resulting from past or current whaling activities should be taken into account when setting quotas for the commercial exploitation of krill if there is to be a recovery to pre-exploitation biomass levels of baleen whales.},

	abstract = {A coupled physical–biological model analysis was undertaken to examine the seasonal development of the distribution of antarctic krill (Euphausia superba Dana) in the Scotia Sea. The origin and fate of krill observed during the CCAMLR 2000 survey were studied using output from the OCCAM model. Lagrangian particle tracking for the period prior to the survey showed the expected dominance of the west to east flow of material associated with the main direction of the current flow, but there was no simple association of particle transport with any of the fronts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Most of the krill were associated with areas to the south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in the Weddell–Scotia Confluence (WSC) and farther east in Weddell Sea-influenced waters. Examining the pathways of krill transport in relation to satellite-derived sea-ice distributions suggests that particles present in the high krill biomass regions in January would have come from areas that were covered by sea-ice during late winter/early spring (September–October). The results of Eulerian grid-based simulations of the development of the biomass distribution after the survey period showed transport of particles around South Georgia, probably in association with the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front. However, many of the krill encountered in the eastern Scotia Sea would have exited toward the east, passing north of the South Sandwich Islands, probably in association with the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and Weddell Sea waters that penetrate to the north in this area. These krill may return to more southern regions where further spawning is possible in later years. Simulations of particle tracks that included diurnal vertical migration showed that krill behavior could modify the pathways of transport, although the current flows probably dominate the movement of krill in open ocean regions. This study suggests that the summer distribution of krill in the Scotia Sea is connected to the winter sea-ice distribution and probably to the pattern and rate of the spring sea-ice retreat. Many of the krill in the survey region in the summer of 1999/2000 came from under the sea-ice in the eastern Scotia Sea, the southern Scotia Arc, and the northern Weddell Sea. This highlights that the spatial association of the sea-ice with the Weddell–Scotia Confluence and frontal regions of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current during winter and spring will be crucial in determining the summer krill distribution. Variation in the extent and timing of sea-ice retreat, and fluctuations in Weddell–Scotia Confluence and Scotia Sea flows, will change the pathways of transport resulting in large changes in the distribution of the krill during summer.},

During the period of the CCAMLR 2000 Survey, commercial krill fishing activities were centered at the South Shetland Islands in the southern Scotia Sea (Subarea 48.1). Fishing patterns, catches, catch rates, and biological information are also presented for the Japanese stern trawler Chiyo maru No. 5, which conducted krill fishing operations in the CCAMLR Subarea 48.1 from 31 January to 1 March, 2000. Information on length and maturity composition is summarized for five regions adjacent to the South Shetland Islands where the Chiyo maru No. 5 fished. The biological information collected from the commercial fishery agrees well with the findings of the CCAMLR 2000 Survey, as well as with a regional acoustic survey conducted by the US AMLR in Subarea 48.1 from February 22 to March 7, 2000. The relationship between the commercial and survey information emphasizes the value of collecting fine-scale biological information from commercial krill fisheries in the Southern Ocean.},

The goal of this study was to understand how these climate-induced changes in light and food regimes may impact the key zooplankton grazer Calanus glacialis CV. We studied this copepod’s metabolic response to starvation (filtered sea water; FSW) and algal food (Food) under two different light regimes (light vs. dark) when it was in dormancy (diapause) in winter (November) and active in summer (July). Respiration was measured as indicator of metabolism and was measured for 9 days for copepods exposed to: Dark+FSW, Dark+Food, Light+FSW and Light+Food. The in situ respiration in winter was three times lower than in summer. In winter, light was the main factor to increase the copepod’s metabolism to a level comparable with that of active copepods in summer, but respiration only remained high if food was present. In summer, it was the combined effect of light and Food that increased the respiration, although Food seemed more important than light with time. Copepods reduced their metabolism with time when food was absent, regardless of the light regime, probably preparing for diapause. These results suggest that C. glacialis can quickly adapt to a changing light and food regime in the Arctic, being able to wake up from diapause if light and thus food appear and postpone its diapause if the food availability is still favorable.},

	abstract = {Synopsis
Calanus finmarchicus, like many other copepods in the family Calanidae, can enter into a facultative diapause during the last juvenile phase (fifth copepodid, C5) to enable survival during unfavorable periods. Diapause is essential to the persistence of Calanus populations and profoundly impacts energy flow within oceanic ecosystems, yet regulation of diapause is not understood in these animals. Transcriptional profiling has begun to provide insight into metabolic changes occurring as C. finmarchicus prepares for and enters into diapause or skips diapause to prepare for the terminal molt. In particular, components of the glycolysis, pentose phosphate and lipid synthesis pathways are upregulated early in the C5 stage when lipid stores are low. Currently, our ability to identify metabolic patterns is limited by the incomplete functional annotation of the C. finmarchicus transcriptome. Such limitations are widespread among studies of non-model organisms and addressing them should be a priority for future research. In addition, integrating the results across multiple emerging complementary transcriptomic studies will provide a more complete picture of copepod physiology than isolated studies. Ultimately, identifying molecular markers of copepod physiology could enable robust identification of animals preparing to enter into diapause and ultimately lead to a greatly improved understanding of diapause regulation.},

Along the northern flank of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, however, the upper ocean has warmed substantially. Here we present analyses of oceanographic observations and general circulation model simulations showing that these patterns—of delayed warming south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and enhanced warming to the north—are fundamentally shaped by the Southern Ocean’s meridional overturning circulation: wind-driven upwelling of unmodified water from depth damps warming around Antarctica; greenhouse gas-induced surface heat uptake is largely balanced by anomalous northward heat transport associated with the equatorward flow of surface waters; and heat is preferentially stored where surface waters are subducted to the north. Further, these processes are primarily due to passive advection of the anomalous warming signal by climatological ocean currents; changes in ocean circulation are secondary. These findings suggest the Southern Ocean responds to greenhouse gas forcing on the centennial, or longer, timescale over which the deep ocean waters that are upwelled to the surface are warmed themselves. It is against this background of gradual warming that multidecadal Southern Ocean temperature trends must be understood.},

A limited understanding of what life is like away from the sun can be inferred from our knowledge of physiology and ecology in the light biosphere, but a full understanding can only be gained by studying animals from the dark biosphere, both in the laboratory and in their natural habitats. One of the least understood aspects of life in the dark biosphere is the rhythmicity of physiology and what it means to live in an environment of low or no rhythmicity. Here we describe methods that may be used to understand rhythmic physiology in the dark and summarise some of the studies of rhythmic physiology in “arrhythmic” environments, such as the poles, deep sea and caves. We review what can be understood about the adaptive value of rhythmic physiology on the Earth’s surface from studies of animals from arrhythmic environments and what role a circadian clock may play in the dark.},

Their main prey were zooplankton, among which the calanoid copepod species of the genus Calanus, long considered key elements of polar marine ecosystems, are particularly abundant. These herbivorous zooplankters display a range of adaptations to the highly seasonal environments of the polar oceans, most notably extensive energy reserves and seasonal migrations to deep waters where the non-feeding season is spent in diapause. Classical work in marine ecology has suggested that slow growth, long lifespan and large body size in zooplankton are specific adaptations to life in cold waters with short and unpredictable feeding seasons. Here, we challenge this understanding and, by using an analogy from the evolutionary and contemporary history of the avocado, argue that predation pressure by the now nearly extinct baleen whales was an important driving force in the evolution of life history diversity in the Arctic Calanus complex.},

	abstract = {The timekeeping mechanisms that operate at the core of circadian clocks (oscillators) are based on interacting molecular feedback loops consisting of clock and clock-associated genes. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies on the expression of clock genes (particularly those forming its core) in single crustacean species at the mRNA and protein levels, and these studies could serve as a basis for constructing a model of the crustacean molecular oscillator. Studies on Daphnia pulex are well suited to fill this gap because this species is the only representative crustacean whose genome has been sequenced. We analyzed the abundance of 20 gene transcripts throughout the day in the whole bodies of D. pulex (single clone); we found that 15 of these genes were transcriptionally active, and most had daily expression level changes. According to the functional classification of their homologues in insects, these genes may represent elements of the Daphnia molecular oscillator core and its input and output pathways. Studies of PERIOD (PER) protein, one of the main clock components, revealed its rhythmic expression pattern in the epidermis, gut, and ovaries. Finally, the cycling levels of many of these clock components observed in animals reared in continuous light led to the conclusion that the Daphnia oscillator, even if it is structurally similar to the oscillators of other arthropods, can be considered a particularly important adaptive mechanism for living in environments with extreme photoperiods.},

A common type of experiment compares rhythmicity in tissues or cells either kept under different conditions or having different genotypes. Such investigations provide insights into underlying mechanisms as well as functions of rhythms.
Results: We present and benchmark a set of statistical and computational methods for this type of analysis, here termed differential rhythmicity analysis. The methods detect alterations in rhythm amplitude, phase and signal to noise ratio in one set of measurements compared to another. Using these methods, we compared circadian rhythms in liver mRNA expression in mice held under two different lighting conditions: constant darkness and light-dark cycles, respectively. This analysis revealed widespread and reproducible amplitude increases in mice kept in light-dark cycles. Further analysis of the subset of differentially rhythmic transcripts implied the immune system in mediating ambient light-dark cycles to rhythmic transcriptional activities. The methods are suitable for genome- or proteome-wide studies, and provide rigorous P values against well-defined null hypotheses.
Availability and Implementation: The methods were implemented as the accompanying R software package DODR, available on CRAN.

For example, circadian rhythms repeat daily with the light-dark cycle. Understanding how such rhythms couple to biological processes requires statistical methods that can identify cycling time series in typical genome-wide data. In this paper, we improve on a method used to identify cycling time series by better estimating the statistical significance of periodic patterns and, in turn, by searching for a wider range of patterns than traditionally investigated. We apply these methods to a compilation of data on gene expression in fruit flies, an important model organism. We find that our method allows us to discover rhythmic biological activities that the other methods tested are unable to reveal.},

After consideration of the effects of some simple filters, different types of serial analysis are discussed systematically according to the variable analyzed or the estimated parameters: scalar magnitudes, angular magnitudes (time or phase), magnitudes related to frequencies (or periods), periodograms, and derived and / or special magnitudes and variables. The use of wavelet analysis and convolutions in long time series is also discussed. In all cases the fundamentals of each method are exposed, jointly with practical considerations and graphic examples.

Size selectivity quantifies a given trawl's ability to catch different sizes of a harvested entity, and this information is crucial for the management of a sustainable fishery. We established a morphological description of krill and used it in a mathematical model (FISHSELECT) to predict the selective potential of diamond meshes measuring 5–40 mm with mesh opening angles (oa) ranging from 10 to 90°. We expected the majority of krill to encounter the trawl netting in random orientations due to high towing speeds and the assumed swimming capabilities of krill. However, our results indicated that size selectivity of krill is a well-defined process in which individuals encounter meshes at an optimal orientation for escapement. The simulation-based results were supported by data from experimental trawl hauls and underwater video images of the mesh geometry during fishing. Herein we present predictions for the size selectivity of a range of netting configurations relevant to the krill fishery. The methods developed and results described are important tools for selecting optimal trawl designs for krill fishing.},

A post-processing technique to estimate the signal-to-noise ratio and remove echosounder background noise. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 64: 1282–1291. A simple and effective post-processing technique to estimate echosounder background-noise levels and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) during active pinging is developed. Similar to other methods of noise estimation during active pinging, this method assumes that some portion of the sampled acoustic signal is dominated by background noise, with a negligible contribution from the backscattered transmit signal. If this assumption is met, the method will provide robust and accurate estimates of background noise equivalent to that measured by the receiver if the transmitter were disabled. It provides repeated noise estimates over short intervals of time without user intervention, which is beneficial in cases where background noise changes over time. In situations where background noise is dominant in a portion of the recorded signal, it is straightforward to make first-order corrections for the effects of noise and to estimate the SNR to evaluate the effects of background noise on acoustic measurements. Noise correction and signal-to-noise-based thresholds have the potential to improve inferences from acoustic measurements in lower signal-to-noise situations, such as when surveying from noisy vessels, using multifrequency techniques, surveying at longer ranges, and when working with weak acoustic targets such as invertebrates and fish lacking swimbladders.},

In the ubiquitous negative binomial model for RNA-seq data, each gene is given a dispersion parameter, and correctly estimating these dispersion parameters is vital to detecting differential expression. Since the dispersions control the variances of the gene counts, underestimation may lead to false discovery, while overestimation may lower the rate of true detection. After briefly reviewing several popular dispersion estimation methods, this article describes a simulation study that compares them in terms of point estimation and the effect on the performance of tests for differential expression. The methods that maximize the test performance are the ones that use a moderate degree of dispersion shrinkage: the DSS, Tagwise wqCML, and Tagwise APL. In practical RNA-seq data analysis, we recommend using one of these moderate-shrinkage methods with the QLShrink test in QuasiSeq R package.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: The ability of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba Dana to withstand the overwintering period is critical to their success. Laboratory evidence suggests that krill may shrink in body length during this time in response to the low availability of food. Nevertheless, verification that krill can shrink in the natural environment is lacking because winter data are difficult to obtain. One of the few sources of winter krill population data is from commercial vessels. We examined length-frequency data of adult krill ({\textgreater}35 mm total body length) obtained from commercial vessels in the Scotia-Weddell region and compared our results with those obtained from a combination of science and commercial sampling operations carried out in this region at other times of the year. Our analyses revealed body-length shrinkage in adult females but not males during winter, based on both the tracking of modal size classes over seasons and sex-ratio patterns. Other explanatory factors, such as differential mortality, immigration and emigration, could not explain the observed differences. The same pattern was also observed at South Georgia and in the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Fitted seasonally modulated von Bertalanffy growth functions predicted a pattern of overwintering shrinkage in all body-length classes of females, but only stagnation in growth in males. This shrinkage most likely reflects morphometric changes resulting from the contraction of the ovaries and is not necessarily an outcome of winter hardship. The sex-dependent changes that we observed need to be incorporated into life cycle and population dynamic models of this species, particularly those used in managing the fishery.},

Synthetic data were used to evaluate how each algorithm responds to different curve shapes, periods, phase shifts, noise levels and sampling rates. The biological datasets we tested represent a variety of periodic processes from different organisms, including the cell cycle and metabolic cycle in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, circadian rhythms in Mus musculus and the root clock in Arabidopsis thaliana.
Results: From these results, we discovered that each algorithm had different strengths. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for selecting and applying these methods depending on the nature of the data and the periodic patterns of interest. Additionally, these results can also be used to inform the design of large-scale biological rhythm experiments so that the resulting data can be used with these algorithms to detect periodic signals more effectively.

	abstract = {Calanus finmarchicus, an abundant calanoid copepod in the North Atlantic Ocean, is both a major grazer on phytoplankton and an important forage species for invertebrate and vertebrate predators. One component of the life history of C. finmarchicus is the overwintering dormancy of sub-adults, a feature key for the annual recruitment of this species in early spring. While little is known about the control of dormancy in C. finmarchicus, one hypothesis is that it is an insect-like diapause, where the endocrine system is a key regulator. One group of hormones implicated in the control of insect diapause is the insulin-like peptides (ILPs). Here, C. finmarchicus transcriptomic data were used to predict ILP signaling pathway proteins. Four ILP precursors were identified, each possessing a distinct A- and B-chain peptide; these peptides are predicted to form bioactive heterodimers via inter-chain disulfide bridging. Two ILP receptors, which likely represent splice variants of a common gene, were identified. Three insulin-degrading enzymes were also discovered, as were proteins encoding the transcription factor FOXO, a downstream target of ILP that has been implicated in the regulation of insect diapause, and insulin receptor substrate, a protein putatively linking the ILP receptor and FOXO. RNA-Seq data suggest that some C. finmarchicus insulin pathway transcripts are differentially expressed across development. As in insects, the ILP signaling system may be involved in controlling C. finmarchicus’ organism-environment interactions (e.g., regulation of seasonal sub-adult diapause), a hypothesis that can now be investigated using these data.},

	abstract = {The effect of the dinoflagellate,  Alexandrium fundyense , on relative expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST) transcripts was examined in the copepod  Calanus finmarchicus . Adult females were fed for 5-days on one of three experimental diets: control (100\%  Rhodomonas  spp.), low dose of  A .  fundyense  (25\% by volume, 75\%  Rhodomonas  spp.), and high dose (100\%  A .  fundyense ). Relative expression of three GST genes was measured using RT-qPCR on days 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 in two independent experiments. Differential regulation was found for the Delta and the Sigma GSTs between 0.5 to 2 days, but not on day 5 in both experiments. The third GST, a microsomal, was not differentially expressed in either treatment or day. RT-qPCR results from the two experiments were similar, even though experimental females were collected from the Gulf of Maine on different dates and their reproductive output differed. In the second experiment, expression of 39 GSTs was determined on days 2 and 5 using RNA-Seq. Global gene expression analyses agreed with the RT-qPCR results. Furthermore, the RNA-Seq measurements indicated that only four GSTs were differentially expressed under the experimental conditions, and the response was small in amplitude. In summary, the  A .  fundyense  diet led to a rapid and transient response in  C .  finmarchicus  in three cytosolic GSTs, while a fourth GST (Omega I) was significantly up-regulated on day 5. Although there was some regulation of GSTs in response the toxic dinoflagellate, the tolerance to  A .  fundyense  by  C .  finmarchicus  is not dependent on the long-term up-regulation of specific GSTs.},

	abstract = {Photoperiodism is an adaptive, seasonal timing system that enables organisms to coordinate their development and physiology to annual changes in the environment using day length (photoperiod) as a cue. This review summarizes our knowledge of the physiological mechanisms underlying photoperiodism in spider mites. In particular, the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae is focussed, which has long been used as a model species for studying photoperiodism. Photoperiodism is established by several physiological modules, such as the photoreceptor, photoperiodic time measurement system, counter system, and endocrine effector. It is now clear that retinal photoreception through the ocelli is indispensable for the function of photoperiodism, at least in T. urticae. Visual pigment, which comprised opsin protein and a vitamin A-based pigment, is involved in photoreception. The physiological basis of the photoperiodic time measurement system is still under debate, and we have controversial evidence for the hourglass-based time measurement and the oscillator-based time measurement. Less attention has been centred on the counter system in insects and mites. Mite reproduction is possibly regulated by the ecdysteroid, ponasterone A. Prior physiological knowledge has laid the foundation for the next steps essential for the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms driving photoperiodism.},

	abstract = {The tendency of ectotherms to get larger in the cold (Bergmann clines) has potentially great implications for individual performance and food web dynamics. The mechanistic drivers of this trend are not well understood, however. One fundamental question is to which extent variation in body size is attributed to variation in cell size, which again is related to genome size. In this study, we analyzed body and genome size in four species of marine calanoid copepods, Calanus finmarchicus, C. glacialis, C. hyperboreus and Paraeuchaeta norvegica, with populations from both south Norwegian fjords and the High Arctic. The Calanus species showed typical interspecific Bergmann clines, and we assessed whether they also displayed similar intraspecific variations—and if correlation between genome size and body size differed between species. There were considerable inter- as well as intraspecific variations in body size and genome size, with the northernmost populations having the largest values of both variables within each species. Positive intraspecific relationships suggest a functional link between body and genome size, although its adaptiveness has not been settled. Impact of additional drivers like phylogeny or specific adaptations, however, was suggested by striking divergences in body size – genome size ratios among species. Thus, C. glacialis and C. hyperboreus, had fairly similar genome size despite very different body size, while P. norvegica, of similar body size as C. hyperboreus, had the largest genome sizes ever recorded from copepods. The inter- and intraspecific latitudinal body size clines suggest that climate change may have major impact on body size composition of keystone species in marine planktonic food webs.},

The lowest lipid content in gonads corresponds to a high percentage of mature reproductive stages (i.e. winter season), independently of sampling area. A variation in total lipid content follows a change in photoperiod, while it is related to sea surface temperature. Multivariate analysis on fatty acid profiles of gonads, detected by gas chromatography, clusters the collected specimens mainly according to the sampling area, secondly according to the sites within the same sampling area and finally according to season.},

Here we show, using optogenetic manipulation and video recording, that a subset of dorsal clock neurons (DN1s) are potent sleep-promoting cells that release glutamate to directly inhibit key pacemaker neurons. The pacemakers promote morning arousal by activating these DN1s, implying that a late-day feedback circuit drives midday siesta and night-time sleep. To investigate more plastic aspects of the sleep program, we used a calcium assay to monitor and compare the real-time activity of DN1 neurons in freely behaving males and females. Our results revealed that DN1 neurons were more active in males than in females, consistent with the finding that male flies sleep more during the day. DN1 activity is also enhanced by elevated temperature, consistent with the ability of higher temperatures to increase sleep. These new approaches indicate that DN1s have a major effect on the fly sleep–wake profile and integrate environmental information with the circadian molecular program.},

Unlike in Drosophila, however, some insects show vertebrate-like traits: The clock machinery involves mammalian type cryptochrome, cycle is rhythmically expressed, and Clock is constitutively expressed. Although the oscillatory mechanisms of the clock are still to be investigated in most insects, RNAi and genome editing technology should accelerate the study, leading toward understanding the origin of variable overt behavioral rhythms such as nocturnal, diurnal, and crepuscular activity rhythms.},

Our tool is a temperature-dependent krill growth model forced by data from comprehensive greenhouse warming simulations. We find that by the year 2100 localized regions along the western Weddell Sea, isolated areas of the Indian Antarctic , and the Amundsen/Bellingshausen Sea will support successful spawning habitats for krill. The failure of potentially successful spawning will have a strong impact on the already declining adult populations with consequences for the Antarctic marine food web, having both ecological and commercial ramifications.},

Biological data on species composition and abundance during this period are scarce due to the logistical challenges posed when sampling these regions. Here, we characterize the plankton community composition during the polar night using water samplers and zooplankton net samples (50, 64, 200, 1500 μm), supplemented by acoustics (ADCPs, 300 kHz), to address a previously unresolved question–which species of zooplankton perform diel vertical migration during the polar night? The protist community (smallest plankton fraction) was mainly represented by ciliates (Strombidiida). In the larger zooplankton fractions (50, 64, 200 μm) the species composition was represented primarily by copepod nauplii and small copepods (e.g., Microcalanus spp., Pseudocalanus spp. and Oithona similis). In the largest zooplankton fraction ({\textgreater}1500 μm), the euphausiid, Thysanoessa inermis, was the most abundant species followed by the chaetognath Parasagitta elegans. Classical DVM was not observed throughout the darkest parts of the polar night (November–mid-January), although, subtle vertical migration patterns were detected in the acoustic data. With the occurrence of a more distinct day–night cycle (i.e., end of January), acoustical DVM signals were observed, paralleled by a classical DVM pattern in February in the largest fractions of zooplankton net samples. We suggest that Thysanoessa spp. are main responsible for the acoustical migration patterns throughout the polar night, although, chaetognaths and copepods may be co-responsible.},

	abstract = {Photoperiodic regulation of the circadian rhythms in insect locomotor activity has been studied in several species, but seasonal entrainment of these rhythms is still poorly understood. We have traced the entrainment of activity rhythm of northern Drosophila montana flies in a climate chamber mimicking the photoperiods and day and night temperatures that the flies encounter in northern Finland during the summer. The experiment was started by transferring freshly emerged females into the chamber in early and late summer conditions to obtain both non-diapausing and diapausing females for the studies. The locomotor activity of the females and daily changes in the expression levels of two core circadian clock genes, timeless and period, in their heads were measured at different times of summer. The study revealed several features in fly rhythmicity that are likely to help the flies to cope with high variation in the day length and temperature typical to northern summers. First, both the non-diapausing and the diapausing females showed evening activity, which decreased towards the short day length as observed in the autumn in nature. Second, timeless and period genes showed concordant daily oscillations and seasonal shifts in their expression level in both types of females. Contrary to Drosophila melanogaster, oscillation profiles of these genes were similar to each other in all conditions, including the extremely long days in early summer and the cool temperatures in late summer, and their peak expression levels were not locked to lights-off transition in any photoperiod. Third, the diapausing females were less active than the non-diapausing ones, in spite of their younger age. Overall, the study showed that D. montana clock functions well under long day conditions, and that both the photoperiod and the daily temperature cycles are important zeitgebers for seasonal changes in the circadian rhythm of this species.},

Here we report the concentrations of dissolved carbohydrates (dCHO) and dissolved EPS (dEPS) in relation to algal standing stock [estimated by chlorophyll (Chl) a concentrations] in sea ice from six locations in the Southern and Arctic Oceans. Concentrations varied substantially within and between sampling sites, reflecting local ice conditions and biological content. However, combining all data revealed robust statistical relationships between dCHO concentrations and the concentrations of different dEPS fractions, Chl a, and DOC. These relationships were true for whole ice cores, bottom ice (biomass rich) sections, and colder surface ice. The distribution of dEPS was strongly correlated to algal biomass, with the highest concentrations of both dEPS and non-EPS carbohydrates in the bottom horizons of the ice. Complex EPS was more prevalent in colder surface sea ice horizons. Predictive models (validated against independent data) were derived to enable the estimation of dCHO concentrations from data on ice thickness, salinity, and vertical position in core. When Chl a data were included a higher level of prediction was obtained. The consistent patterns reflected in these relationships provide a strong basis for including estimates of regional and seasonal carbohydrate and dEPS carbon budgets in coupled physical-biogeochemical models, across different types of sea ice from both polar regions.},

The large-scale phytoplankton distribution patterns across the receding ice edge and small-scale profiling of the water column adjacent to melting ice floes indicated marked patchiness on both scales. The contribution of typical ice algae to the phytoplankton was not significant. In experiments simulating the conditions during sea ice melting, ice algae revealed a strong propensity to form aggregates. Differences in the aggregation potential were found for algal assemblages collected from the ice interior and the infiltration layer. Although all algal species collected from the ice were also found in aggregates, the species composition of dispersed and aggregated algae differed significantly. Aggregates were of a characteristic structure consisting of monospecific microaggregates which are likely to have formed in the minute brine pockets and channels within the ice. Sinking rates of aggregates were three orders of magnitude higher than those of dispersed ice algae. These observations, combined with the negligible seeding effect of ice algae found during this study, suggest that ice algae released from the melting sea ice are subject to rapid sedimentation. High grazing pressure at the ice edge of the investigation area is another factor eliminating ice algae released during melting.},

In this study, next generation sequencing was used to assemble transcriptomic reads and then putative homologs of known core and accessory circadian genes were identified in these databases. Homologous transcripts were discovered for one circadian clock input gene, five core genes, 22 accessory genes, and two possible output pathways. Alignments and functional domain analyses showed generally high conservation between the putative L. polyphemus clock genes and homologs from Drosophila melanogaster and Daphnia pulex. The presence of both cry1 and cry2 in the L. polyphemus transcriptome would classify its system as an “ancestral”, type 2 clock system. In addition, a novel duplication of CYCLE, and a novel triplication of PERIOD were found. Investigations are currently underway to determine if any of these “circadian” genes also participate in the molecular processes that drive the Limulus circatidal clock.},

Calanus spp. numerically dominated the herbivores; Aglantha digitale, Mertensia ovum, Beroë cucumis, and Parasagitta elegans were the dominant carnivores. Omnivores and detritivores were numerically less important. Descent to deeper regions of the water column ({\textgreater}100 m) between August and October, and ascent to the shallower region ({\textless}100 m) between November and May was the overall seasonal pattern in this zooplankton community. In contrast to other groups, P. elegans did not exhibit pronounced vertical migrations. Seasonal vertical distributions of most species showed statistical associations with the availability of their main food source. The vertical distribution of later developmental stages of Calanus spp. was inversely associated with fluorescence, indicating that they descended from the shallower region while it was still relatively productive, and ascended before the primary production had started to increase. Strong associations between the vertical distributions of secondary consumer M. ovum and Calanus spp., and tertiary consumer B. cucumis and M. ovum indicated that these carnivores seasonally followed their prey through the water column. We conclude that seasonal vertical migrations are a widespread trait in the high Arctic community studied, and predator-prey interactions seem particularly central in shaping the associations between the seasonal vertical strategies of adjacent trophic levels.},

Another dividend is the feasibility of deriving confidence intervals for parameters of rhythmic components of known periods, readily drawn from the least squares procedure, stressing the importance of prior (external) information. Originally developed for the analysis of short and sparse data series, the extended cosinor has been further developed for the analysis of long time series, focusing both on rhythm detection and parameter estimation. Attention is given to the assumptions underlying the use of the cosinor and ways to determine whether they are satisfied. In particular, ways of dealing with non-stationary data are presented. Examples illustrate the use of the different cosinor-based methods, extending their application from the study of circadian rhythms to the mapping of broad time structures (chronomes).},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Antarctic krill Euphausia superba are a key component of food webs in the maritime West Antarctic Peninsula, and their life history is tied to the seasonal cycles of sea ice and primary production in the region. Previous work has shown a general in-shore migration of krill in winter in this region; however, the very near-shore has not often been sampled as part of these surveys. We investigated distribution, abundance, and size structure of krill in 3 fjordic bays along the peninsula, and in the adjacent Gerlache Strait area using vertically stratified MOCNESS net tows and ADCP acoustic biomass estimates. Krill abundance was high within bays, with net estimated densities exceeding 60 krill m-3, while acoustic estimates were an order of magnitude higher. Krill within bays were larger than krill in the Gerlache Strait. Within bays, krill aggregations were observed near the seafloor during the day with aggregations extending to the sediment interface, and exhibited diel vertical migration higher into the water column at night. We suggest these high winter krill abundances within fjords are indicative of an active seasonal migration by krill in the peninsula region. Potential drivers for such a migration include reduced advective losses and costs, and availability of sediment food resources within fjords. Seasonally near-shore krill may also affect stock and recruitment assessments and may have implications for managing the krill fishery in this area.},

Krill feeding is thus important to ecosystem carbon cycling. Traditional approaches to determining in-situ krill feeding require a priori assumptions, and may have prey-type detection biases. We took a DNA-based approach to measuring in-situ feeding by northern krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica. The diversity of prey consumed by M. norvegica in situ was analyzed for 80 krill at 8 stations throughout the Gulf of Maine (North Atlantic) using peptide nucleic acid mediated polymerase chain reaction (PNA-PCR) clone library sequencing of 18S rDNA. Relative abundance of the 2 most common prey types was measured with quantitative PCR (qPCR) in the guts of 16 krill. The 245 prey sequences recovered from krill gut contents included copepods, salps, phytoplankton, and a poorly known organism found to be sediment associated. Calanus finmarchicus and the sediment-associated organism were found most commonly, at 7 and 8 stations, respectively, and their 18S rDNA was present in nearly equal quantities in individual krill guts. M. norvegica, like most krill, are typically considered planktivorous; thus krill feeding on sediment organisms represents an unrecognized pathway for carbon flow from the sediment to the pelagic. Calculations suggest that this unrecognized pathway could potentially bring over 100000 t of carbon annually back into the Gulf of Maine pelagic ecosystem, equivalent to 4\% of annual primary production, or the energy demands of 80\% of the region’s fin whale population.},

Grazing activity (phytoplankton pigments in the gut) and the percentage of recently and nonrecently fed copepods (from observation of food in the gut) were monitored in two strata (0–30 m and 30–100 m). Phytoplankton was restricted to the upper stratum. A bimodal twilight grazing rhythm was observed: the first feeding period, in the upper stratum, begins after sunset; it is followed by the “midnight sinking” in the deeper stratum (2–3 h), during which the gut content is evacuated; after this, the animals return to the upper stratum for a second meal, before the dawn descent. In both migrations, there was a dynamic interchange of individuals between the two strata, which masked the fact that all the copepods migrated to the upper stratum and that a dawn rise actually happened. The feeding time in the warmer surface water was very short. Feeding ceased rapidly even if phytoplankton concentration was low. A large increase in the number of migrants did not change the feeding patterns. Results support the hypothesis that the behavior of C. finmarchicus during the central phase of vertical migrations in late summer is closely linked to an in situ grazing rhythm.},

	abstract = {Diel changes in the particulate environment and nutritional metabolism of neritic zooplankton were studied in the Bay of Villefranche-sur-mer (France) for 30 h during February. Although the survey was carried out over a period of negligible wind speed, the changes in the particle size spectra and species composition of the Zooplankton sampled suggested an abrupt and temporary oscillation in the water mass at the second sampling time. The rest of the 30-h period was characterized by gradual changes which usually returned to conditions close to, but different from, the starting ones. A clear diel rhythm was recorded for the biochemical composition of the phytoplankton, probably related to the periodicity of the photosynthetic metabolism. The feeding rate of Clausocalanus arcuicornis Giesbrecht, 1888, measured by gut fluorescence, also showed diel rhythmicity with maximum rate at night. Digestive enzyme activities were measured on the total Zooplankton population composed of five major species: Clausocalanus arcuicornis, Paracalanus sp., Calanus helgolandicus Claus, 1863, Acartia clausi Giesbrecht, 1889, and Oikopleura dioica Fol, 1859. The activities of the carbohydrases showed varying patterns of periodicity with one or two night maxima. The proteases showed a different pattern with acidic proteases peaking just before dawn and decreasing gradually during the day and no periodicity for trypsin-like activity. No association could be established between the enzyme changes and those of either the food supply or the species composition of the Zooplankton sampled, suggesting that both feeding and digestion diel rhythms are controlled by an internal clock. Influences of internal, external and experimental factors on the digestive enzyme activity rhythm are discussed. The resulting scheme of short term regulation was compared with that proposed earlier for medium term changes.},

	abstract = {Insects inhabiting the temperate zones measure seasonal changes in day or night length to enter the overwintering diapause. Diapause induction occurs after the duration of the night exceeds a critical night length (CNL). Our understanding of the time measurement mechanisms is continuously evolving subsequent to Bünning's proposal that circadian systems play the clock role in photoperiodic time measurement (Bünning, 1936). Initially, the photoperiodic clocks were considered to be either based on circadian oscillators or on simple hour-glasses, depending on ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ responses in Nanda–Hamner and Bünsow experiments (Nanda \& Hammer, 1958; Bünsow, 1960). However, there are also species whose responses can be regarded as neither ‘positive’, nor as ‘negative’, such as the Northern Drosophila species Drosophila ezoana, which is investigated in the present study. In addition, modelling efforts show that the ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ Nanda–Hamner responses can also be provoked by circadian oscillators that are damped to different degrees: animals with highly sustained circadian clocks will respond ‘positive’ and those with heavily damped circadian clocks will respond ‘negative’. In the present study, an experimental assay is proposed that characterizes the photoperiodic oscillators by determining the effects of non-24-h light/dark cycles (T-cycles) on critical night length. It is predicted that there is (i) a change in the critical night length as a function of T-cycle period in sustained-oscillator-based clocks and (ii) a fixed night-length measurement (i.e. no change in critical night length) in damped-oscillator-based clocks. Drosophila ezoana flies show a critical night length of approximately 7 h irrespective of T-cycle period, suggesting a damped-oscillator-based photoperiodic clock. The conclusion is strengthened by activity recordings revealing that the activity rhythm of D. ezoana flies also dampens in constant darkness.},

In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the light entrainment mechanisms of the clock have been well-studied. The Drosophila brain contains approximately 150 neurons that rhythmically express circadian clock genes. These neurons are called “clock neurons” and control behavioral activity rhythms. Many clock neurons express the Cryptochrome (CRY) protein, which is sensitive to UV and blue light, and thus enables clock neurons deep in the brain to directly perceive light. In addition to the CRY protein, external photoreceptors in the Drosophila eyes play an important role in circadian light-input pathways. Recent studies have provided new insights into the mechanisms that integrate these light inputs into the circadian network of the brain. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge on the light entrainment pathways in the Drosophila circadian clock.},

	abstract = {Summary
Seasonal synchronization based on day length (photoperiod) allows organisms to anticipate environmental change. Photoperiodic decoding relies on circadian clocks, but the underlying molecular pathways have remained elusive [1]. In mammals and birds, photoperiodic responses depend crucially on expression of thyrotrophin β subunit RNA (TSHβ) in the pars tuberalis (PT) of the pituitary gland [2–4]. Now, using our well-characterized Soay sheep model [2], we describe a molecular switch governing TSHβ transcription through the circadian clock. Central to this is a conserved D element in the TSHβ promoter, controlled by the circadian transcription factor thyrotroph embryonic factor (Tef). In the PT, long-day exposure rapidly induces expression of the coactivator eyes absent 3 (Eya3), which synergizes with Tef to maximize TSHβ transcription. The pineal hormone melatonin, secreted nocturnally, sets the phase of rhythmic Eya3 expression in the PT to peak 12 hr after nightfall. Additionally, nocturnal melatonin levels directly suppress Eya3 expression. Together, these effects form a switch triggering a strong morning peak of Eya3 expression under long days. Species variability in the TSHβ D element influences sensitivity to TEF, reflecting species variability in photoperiodic responsiveness. Our findings define a molecular pathway linking the circadian clock to the evolution of seasonal timing in mammals.},

	abstract = {Daily light and feeding cycles act as powerful synchronizers of circadian rhythmicity. Ultimately, these external cues entrain the expression of clock genes, which generate daily rhythmic behavioral and physiological responses in vertebrates. In the present study, we investigated clock genes in a marine teleost (gilthead sea bream). Partial cDNA sequences of key elements from both positive (Bmal1, Clock) and negative (Per2, Cry1) regulatory loops were cloned before studying how feeding time affects the daily rhythms of locomotor activity and clock gene expression in the central (brain) and peripheral (liver) oscillators. To this end, all fish were kept under a light-dark (LD) cycle and were divided into three experimental groups, depending on the time of their daily meal: mid-light (ML), mid-darkness (MD), or at random (RD) times. Finally, the existence of circadian control on gene expression was investigated in the absence of external cues (DD + RD). The behavioral results showed that seabream fed at ML or RD displayed a diurnal activity pattern ({\textgreater}91\% of activity during the day), whereas fish fed at MD were nocturnal (89\% of activity during the night). Moreover, seabream subjected to regular feeding cycles (ML and MD groups) showed food-anticipatory activity (FAA). Regardless of the mealtime, the daily rhythm of clock gene expression in the brain peaked close to the light-dark transition in the case of Bmal1 and Clock, and at the beginning of the light phase in the case of Per2 and Cry1, showing the existence of phase delay between the positive and negative elements of the molecular clock. In the liver, however, the acrophases of the daily rhythms differed depending on the feeding regime: the maximum expression of Bmal1 and Clock in the ML and RD groups was in antiphase to the expression pattern observed in the fish fed at MD. Under constant conditions (DD + RD), Per2 and Cry1 showed circadian rhythmicity in the brain, whereas Bmal1, Clock, and Per2 did in the liver. Our results indicate that the seabream clock gene expression is endogenously controlled and in liver it is strongly entrained by food signals, rather than by the LD cycle, and that scheduled feeding can shift the phase of the daily rhythm of clock gene expression in a peripheral organ (liver) without changing the phase of these rhythms in a central oscillator (brain), suggesting uncoupling of the light-entrainable oscillator (LEO) from the food-entrainable oscillator (FEO). These findings provide the basis and new tools for improving our knowledge of the circadian system and entraining pathways of this fish species, which is of great interest for the Mediterranean aquaculture.

Gene transcription is a central timekeeping process in animal clocks. In Drosophila, the basic helix-loop helix (bHLH)-PAS transcription-factor heterodimer, CLOCK/CYCLE (CLK/CYC), transcriptionally activates the clock components period (per), timeless (tim), Par domain protein 1 (Pdp1), and vrille (vri), which feed back and regulate distinct features of CLK/CYC function [1]. Microarray studies have identified numerous rhythmically expressed transcripts [2–7], some of which are potential direct CLK targets [7]. Here we demonstrate a circadian function for one such target, a bHLH-Orange repressor, CG17100/CLOCKWORK ORANGE (CWO). cwo is rhythmically expressed, and levels are reduced in Clk mutants, suggesting that cwo is CLK activated in vivo. cwo mutants display reduced-amplitude molecular and behavioral rhythms with lengthened periods. Molecular analysis suggests that CWO acts, in part, by repressing CLK target genes. We propose that CWO acts as a transcriptional and behavioral rhythm amplifier.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Climate influences a population through a variety of processes, including reproduction, growth, migration patterns and phenology. Climate may operate either directly through metabolic and reproductive processes or indirectly through prey, predators, and competitors. One mechanism that may be particularly important, and which is the focus of this review, is the role of climate in affecting the reproductive success of a predator through its effect on the relative timing of food requirement and food availability during early life stages. This principle—the match or mismatch of predators’ requirement with resource availability—originated in the marine literature, where it initially referred to how growth and survival of fish larvae (predator) depends on this production being synchronous with that of their main food items, i.e. early stage zooplankton (prey). Here we review how the match/mismatch hypothesis (MMH) is used to describe climate effects on ecological patterns and processes in both marine and terrestrial systems. In addition to studying match/mismatch sensu stricto, we expand on it to include effects of overall production level and the spatial aspect. Possible impacts of climate change on match/mismatch are examined in the context of one of the most apparent effects of global warming: an advancement of spring phenology. As a consequence of different species reacting dissimilarly, even minor changes in climate may invoke non-linear responses unbalancing established patterns of synchrony. All components of a food chain cannot be expected to shift their phenology at the same rate, and thus are unlikely to remain synchronous.},

	abstract = {Climate change is affecting numerous species worldwide, including dominant and important copepods of the genus Calanus. Despite the growing body of studies that examine effects of climate change stressors on Calanus species, comparative intraspecific studies are lacking. Importantly, acclimatization and genetic adaptation can modify the stress response, thus leading to a differential response of separated populations to the same stressor. The molecular and physiological responses of a C. finmarchicus population from the mid-Atlantic, with an in situ temperature of 8.5 °C, were investigated under experimental thermal conditions of 0 °C, 5 °C, 10 °C, 15 °C, and 20 °C for durations of 3 h and 6 days. This experimental set-up mirrored previously published experiments conducted on C. finmarchicus at the northern limit of its distribution allowing a comparison between two populations. The greatest physiological response, assessed as fecal pellet production, was seen after 3 h exposure at 10 °C and 15 °C, and after 6 days exposure at 5 °C, 10 °C and 15 °C. Molecular response was assessed by the change in expression of 5 selected genes: hsp70\_2, dnaja1, nap 1l1, rps11, and gdh. Only two out of the five genes (gdh and nap1l1) showed significant up-regulation with increased temperature and duration of exposure. These findings differ from the results obtained in the northern population where all 5 genes were differently expressed. Overall, the results suggest population-specific response to temperature in C. finmarchicus, however determining the source of such variation (genetic adaptation or acclimatization) requires more detailed studies.},

A further aim is to examine the hypothesis that dietary prey size spectra remain the same during the larval stage when viewed on a relative predator/prey size scale. The study is based on stomach analysis of larval/juvenile cod in the size range 10–35 mm from nursery grounds in the North Sea. Stomach contents (species, size) were compared to environmental composition and preference indices were calculated. Prey size spectra had the expected relationship to larval cod size, and preference for given copepod species could be ascribed to their relative size. Additional species-specific preferences were evident, for example the larger Pseudocalanus and the larger Calanus spp. were highly preferred. Available prey biomass was highest in the areas of a hydrographic front, where larvae have been shown to concentrate. Changes in prey availability with larval growth depend strongly on specific prey biomass spectra at a given location. Both increasing and decreasing prey availability at increasing larval size were indicated, dependent on location. The findings illustrate the usefulness of coupling dietary prey size spectra and biomass spectra of available prey sizes during studies of ichthyoplankton feeding ecology.},

Calanus finmarchicus was the principal prey of mackerel, accounting for 53–98\% of total stomach content by weight. The diet composition of herring varied depending on feeding area and availability of food under various environmental conditions. C. finmarchicus was important prey for herring only in July 2001 (about 77\% by weight) in the central part of the sea and in June 2002 (about 82\% by weight) near the Lofotens. In July 2002 appendicularians (Oikopleura spp.), amphipods (mainly Parathemisto abissorum), and euphausiids were important in the diet of herring, and at some stations cannibalism was observed. The main prey of blue whiting were amphipods (10–34\% by weight), appendicularians (11–34\%), and euphausiids (8–47\%), as they usually feed deep in the water column, though C. finmarchicus was important, particularly in June 2002, when blue whiting were caught in the upper layers of the sea. Higher water temperatures indirectly affect pelagic fish through accelerated development of their prey and favourable conditions for migration farther north.},

	abstract = {Background: Genes encoding the circadian pacemaker in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of mammals have recently been identified, but the molecular basis of circadian timing in peripheral tissue is not well understood. We used a custom-made cDNA microarray to identify mouse liver transcripts that show circadian cycles of abundance under constant conditions.

Results: Using two independent tissue sampling and hybridization regimes, we show that ∼9\% of the 2122 genes studied show robust circadian cycling in the liver. These transcripts were categorized by their phase of abundance, defining clusters of day- and night-related genes, and also by the function of their products. Circadian regulation of genes was tissue specific, insofar as novel rhythmic liver genes were not necessarily rhythmic in the brain, even when expressed in the SCN. The rhythmic transcriptome in the periphery is, nevertheless, dependent on the SCN because surgical ablation of the SCN severely dampened or destroyed completely the cyclical expression of both canonical circadian genes and novel genes identified by microarray analysis.

Conclusions: Temporally complex, circadian programming of the transcriptome in a peripheral organ is imposed across a wide range of core cellular functions and is dependent on an interaction between intrinsic, tissue-specific factors and extrinsic regulation by the SCN central pacemaker.},

We have used gene expression profiling to identify cycling transcripts in the SCN and in the liver.

Genetic and genomic analysis suggests that a relatively small number of output genes are directly regulated by core oscillator components. Major processes regulated by the SCN and liver were found to be under circadian regulation.

C. finmarchicus is one of many zooplankton species that exhibit diel vertical migration. Light is considered the main proximate cause of diel vertical migration, but irradiance sensitivity is unknown for many ecologically important zooplankton taxa, including C. finmarchicus. Here we studied phototaxis in C. finmarchicus in response to low levels of irradiance using a custom-made experimental setup under controlled laboratory conditions. The setup consisted of an aquarium with a light stimulus in one end of a raceway. A video camera and near-infrared light for illumination were applied to monitor the response to light in the horizontal plane. Low levels of irradiance were achieved using a white LED and a combination of absorptive neutral density filters and diode pulsing.

Stage V copepodites and adult females displayed negative phototaxis, and the threshold for phototactic response was 9.8 × 10− 6 μmol photons m− 2 s− 1. Adult males displayed positive phototaxis and the corresponding threshold value was 9.9 × 10− 7 μmol photons m− 2 s− 1. The results from the experiments were used to estimate the depths at which phototaxis is elicited in natural light conditions by conducting light simulations for an ocean scenario and a fjord scenario during peak spring bloom conditions. The estimated depths for irradiances that elicit a phototactic response corresponded to approximate depths of 158–186 m in the ocean scenario and 48–57 m in the fjord scenario. These depths are within the range of depth distributions of C. finmarchicus reported for ocean and fjord populations.},

	abstract = {Many organisms use circadian clocks to keep temporal order and anticipate daily environmental changes. In Drosophila, the master clock gene Clock promotes the transcription of several key target genes. Two of these gene products, PER and TIM, repress CLK–CYC-mediated transcription. To recognize additional direct CLK target genes, we designed a genome-wide approach and identified clockwork orange (cwo) as a new core clock component. cwo encodes a transcriptional repressor that synergizes with PER and inhibits CLK-mediated activation. Consistent with this function, the mRNA profiles of CLK direct target genes in cwo mutant flies manifest high trough values and low amplitude oscillations. Because behavioral rhythmicity fails to persist in constant darkness (DD) with little or no effect on average mRNA levels in flies lacking cwo, transcriptional oscillation amplitude appears to be linked to rhythmicity. Moreover, the mutant flies are long period, consistent with the late repression indicated by the RNA profiles. These findings suggest that CWO acts preferentially in the late night to help terminate CLK–CYC-mediated transcription of direct target genes including cwo itself. The presence of mammalian homologs with circadian expression features (Dec1 and Dec2) suggests that a similar feedback mechanism exists in mammalian clocks.},

	abstract = {In contrast to photoperiodic rodent species, adult circannual European hamsters (Cricetus cricetus) do not rely on melatonin as transducer of the photoperiodic message. Instead, seasonal entrainment involves a special circadian organisation which characterizes a photoperiod-sensitive phase. When days shorten a precise activity pattern (“summer pattern”) switches to a weak or arrhythmic “winter pattern”. At the very same day gonadal regression is initiated and the circannual clock is reset. In contrast to this difference in photoperiodic time measurement, the broad time span in which offspring are born and the birth-season dependent timing of puberty is similar to photoperiodic rodents. We investigated how juvenile European hamsters measure photoperiod to situate themselves at the proper position in the annual cycle. Activity and 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) excretion were recorded in pups of five litters born at different seasons. Pups of all litters showed an activity pattern identical with the adults' summer pattern until postnatal day 78, suggesting that the pathway known to reset the circannual clock in adults is functional. The synchronous start of reproduction in yearlings supports this. However, since puberty and gonadal regression occurred before the switch in the activity pattern, the timing of reproduction in the birth year must be controlled by other means. As in photoperiodic species melatonin might be involved, since the aMT6s excretion showed daily and seasonal rhythms from early life on.},

Recently, we used differential analysis to identify that the type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio2) gene is responsible for the photoperiodic response of gonads in Japanese quail. It was found that expression of Dio2 in the mediobasal hypothalamus is induced by light and that T3 content in the mediobasal hypothalamus increased under long day conditions. In addition, we showed that intracerebroventricular infusion of T3 mimics photoperiodically induced testicular growth. Because it is well known that thyroid hormone is also essential for the maintenance of the seasonal reproductive changes in a number of mammals, we examined expression of Dio2 in Djungarian hamsters and found expression in the ependymal cell layer lining the infralateral walls of the third ventricle and the cell-clear zone overlying the tuberoinfundibular sulcus. Signal intensity was high under long days and weak under short days. Although light pulse did not affect Dio2 expression, melatonin injections decreased Dio2 expression under long days. These results indicate that Dio2 may be involved in the regulation of seasonal reproduction in mammals in the same way as observed in birds.},

The kinetics, regularity, and specificity of microbial responses in situ, however, are not well-described. We report here simultaneous multitaxon genome-wide transcriptome profiling in a naturally occurring picoplankton community. An in situ robotic sampler using a Lagrangian sampling strategy enabled continuous tracking and repeated sampling of coherent microbial populations over 2 d. Subsequent RNA sequencing analyses yielded genome-wide transcriptome profiles of eukaryotic (Ostreococcus) and bacterial (Synechococcus) photosynthetic picoplankton as well as proteorhodopsin-containing heterotrophs, including Pelagibacter, SAR86-cluster Gammaproteobacteria, and marine Euryarchaea. The photosynthetic picoplankton exhibited strong diel rhythms over thousands of gene transcripts that were remarkably consistent with diel cycling observed in laboratory pure cultures. In contrast, the heterotrophs did not cycle diurnally. Instead, heterotrophic picoplankton populations exhibited cross-species synchronous, tightly regulated, temporally variable patterns of gene expression for many genes, particularly those genes associated with growth and nutrient acquisition. This multitaxon, population-wide gene regulation seemed to reflect sporadic, short-term, reversible responses to high-frequency environmental variability. Although the timing of the environmental responses among different heterotrophic species seemed synchronous, the specific metabolic genes that were expressed varied from taxon to taxon. In aggregate, these results provide insights into the kinetics, diversity, and functional patterns of microbial community response to environmental change. Our results also suggest a means by which complex multispecies metabolic processes could be coordinated, facilitating the regulation of matter and energy processing in a dynamically changing environment.},

Stratigraphic analyses of the cores were also carried out. Bulk nutrient concentrations in the sea ice fluctuated widely and did not correlate with salinity. Nutrient concentrations in cores were normalized to sea-water salinity to facilitate comparison. They varied between zero and two or three times those measured in the water column. Differentiation into young and old sea ice, however, revealed that nutrient concentrations in the young ice in many cases corresponded to those in surface seawater. In older ice, nutrients showed signs of increase as well as depletion or exhaustion relative to the water column. Differentiation of core sections according to ice textural classes and analyses of brine samples clarified some relationships between nutrients, salinity and algal biomass. Most of the changes in the nutrient concentrations are attributed to an increase in biological activity as the seasons progress. Silicate is expected to become the first nutrient likely to limit growth of diatoms in the ice which is ascribed to slower regeneration or dissolution of this nutrient relative to phosphate and nitrate. A consequence of silicate exhaustion may be the succession of different algal assemblages, from a diatom dominated community to one in which autotrophic flagellates form the largest component.},

	abstract = {Large-scale biogeographical changes in the biodiversity of a key zooplankton group (calanoid copepods) were detected in the north-eastern part of the North Atlantic Ocean and its adjacent seas over the period 1960–1999. These findings provided key empirical evidence for climate change impacts on marine ecosystems at the regional to oceanic scale. Since 1999, global temperatures have continued to rise in the region. Here, we extend the analysis to the period 1958–2005 using all calanoid copepod species assemblages (nine species assemblages based on an analysis including a total of 108 calanoid species or taxa) and show that this phenomenon has been reinforced in all regions. Our study reveals that the biodiversity of calanoid copepods are responding quickly to sea surface temperature (SST) rise by moving geographically northward at a rapid rate up to about 23.16 km yr−1. Our analysis suggests that nearly half of the increase in sea temperature in the northeast Atlantic and adjacent seas is related to global temperature rises (46.35\% of the total variance of temperature) while changes in both natural modes of atmospheric and oceanic circulation explain 26.45\% of the total variance of temperature. Although some SST isotherms have moved northwards by an average rate of up to 21.75 km yr−1 (e.g. the North Sea), their movement cannot fully quantify all species assemblage shifts. Furthermore, the observed rates of biogeographical movements are far greater than those observed in the terrestrial realm. Here, we discuss the processes that may explain such a discrepancy and suggest that the differences are mainly explained by the fluid nature of the pelagic domain, the life cycle of the zooplankton and the lesser anthropogenic influence (e.g. exploitation, habitat fragmentation) on these organisms. We also hypothesize that despite changes in the path and intensity of the oceanic currents that may modify quickly and greatly pelagic zooplankton species, these organisms may reflect better the current impact of climate warming on ecosystems as terrestrial organisms are likely to significantly lag the current impact of climate change.},

The years were characterized by high water temperatures during the preceding winter, and by a low abundance of Calanus finmarchicus, the principal food of the herring. The low abundance of C. finmarchicus was probably related to the high water temperatures. Both the high temperature and the scarcity of food could explain the northern distribution of the herring.

Apart from the 1988–1990 anomaly, a long-term northward shift of catches occurred from 1960 to 1990. This northward trend in catches coincided with a gradual increase in winter temperature, and a sustained decrease of C. finmarchicus. The long-term shift in herring catches, therefore, could signify a gradual change in distribution of the stock, brought about by the same factors that caused the 1988–1990 anomaly. If the recent climatic trend towards higher winter temperatures continues, the anomalous distribution of herring in 1988–1990 could become the normal pattern in future years.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Global climate change is expected to modify the spatial distribution of marine organisms. However, projections of future changes should be based on robust information on the ecological niche of species. This paper presents a macroecological study of the environmental tolerance and ecological niche (sensu Hutchinson 1957, i.e. the field of tolerance of a species to the principal factors of its environment) of Calanus finmarchicus and C. helgolandicus in the North Atlantic Ocean and adjacent seas. Biological data were collected by the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) Survey, which samples plankton in the North Atlantic and adjacent seas at a standard depth of 7 m. Eleven parameters were chosen including bathymetry, temperature, salinity, nutrients, mixed-layer depth and an index of turbulence compiled from wind data and chlorophyll a concentrations (used herein as an index of available food). The environmental window and the optimum level were determined for both species and for each abiotic factor and chlorophyll concentration. The most important parameters that influenced abundance and spatial distribution were temperature and its correlates such as oxygen and nutrients. Bathymetry and other water-column-related parameters also played an important role. The ecological niche of C. finmarchicus was larger than that of C. helgolandicus and both niches were significantly separated. Our results have important implications in the context of global climate change. As temperature (and to some extent stratification) is predicted to continue to rise in the North Atlantic sector, changes in the spatial distribution of these 2 Calanus species can be expected. Application of this approach to the 1980s North Sea regime shift provides evidence that changes in sea temperature alone could have triggered the substantial and rapid changes identified in the dynamic regimes of these ecosystems. C. finmarchicus appears to be a good indicator of the Atlantic Polar Biome (mainly the Atlantic Subarctic and Arctic provinces) while C. helgolandicus is an indicator of more temperate waters (Atlantic Westerly Winds Biome) in regions characterised by more pronounced spatial changes in bathymetry.},

	abstract = {Zooplankton were collected from five depth strata (0-25-50-100-200-500 m) at 12 stations along two sections across the Nansen Basin of the Arctic Ocean in July/August 1987. Vertical and horizontal distribution of biomass and abundance of the four dominant copepod species Calanus finmarchicus, C. glacialis, C. hyperboreus and Metridia longa, together with their gonad maturity state, are presented. Egg production of C. finmarchicus, C. glacialis and Metridia longa was measured from concurrent Bongo net samples in the upper 80 m. Four biological provinces were distinguished, which closely agreed with the hydrographic regimes. In the south, the Barents Shelf slope and the Southern Transition were located in the boundary current system of Atlantic water flowing eastward along the Eurasian shelves. They were characterized by the dominance of Calanus finmarchicus. The Barents Shelf slope, representing the core of the boundary current, hosted large populations of C. hyperboreus and Metridia longa. Metridia longa, with its main occurrence in the depth of the Atlantic layer, was the biological marker of this province. The southern provinces were separated from the Central Nansen Basin and the Nansen-Gakkel Ridge by a sharp discontinuity in biomass, stage distribution and gonad maturity of the three Calanus species north of 83°N. This faunistic boundary coincided with a well defined hydrographic frontal zone. Apparently, zooplankton distribution followed closely the flow of Atlantic water below 60-200 m eastward, although the three Calanus species had their center of abundance in the surface layer consisting of polar water, which supposedly follows the Transpolar Drift westward.},

	abstract = {The least known component of the “biological pump” is the active transport of carbon and nutrients by diel vertical migration of zooplankton. We measured CO2 respiration and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) excretion by individual species of common vertically migrating zooplankton at the US JGOFS Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) station. The inclusion of DOC excretion in this study builds on published research on active transport by respiration of inorganic carbon and allows a direct assessment of the role of zooplankton in the production of dissolved organic matter used in midwater microbial processes. On average, excretion of DOC makes up 24\% (range=5–42\%) of the total C metabolized (excreted+respired) and could represent a significant augmentation to the vertical flux that has already been documented for respiratory CO2 flux by migrant zooplankton. Migratory fluxes were compared to other transport processes at BATS. Estimates of combined active transport of CO2 and DOC by migrators at BATS averaged 7.8\% and reached 38.6\% of mean sinking POC flux at 150 m, and reached 71.4\% of mean sinking POC flux at 300 m. DOC export by migrator excretion averaged 1.9\% and reached 13.3\% of annual DOC export by physical mixing at this site. During most of the year when deep mixing does not occur, diel migration by zooplankton could provide a supply of DOC to the deeper layers that is available for use by the microbial community. A carbon budget comparing migrant zooplankton transport to the balance of fluxes in the 300–600 m depth strata at BATS shows on average that the total migrant flux supplies 37\% of the organic carbon remineralized in this layer, and that migrant DOC flux is more than 3 times the DOC flux gradient by diapycnal mixing. New estimates of active transport of both organic and inorganic carbon by migrants may help resolve observed imbalances in the C budget at BATS, but the magnitude is highly dependent on the biomass of the migrating community.},

We have identified a remarkable range in the FRPs between field-lines, with the fastest clock at {\textasciitilde}21 h and the slowest close to 28 h, a range comparable to the collections of clock mutants in model organisms. Similarly, field-lines differed in the percentage of rhythmic individuals, with a minimum of 13.8\% and a maximum of 86.8\%. Although the FRP correlates with the latitude and perhaps with the altitude of the locality, the actual function of this FRP diversity is currently unclear. With the recent technological progress of massive parallel sequencing and genome editing, we can expect remarkable progress in elucidating the genetic basis of similar geographic variants in P. apterus or in similar emerging model species of chronobiology.},

Circadian clocks generate 24-hr rhythms in physiology and behavior. Despite numerous studies, it is still uncertain how circadian rhythms emerge from their molecular and neural constituents. Here, we demonstrate a tight connection between the molecular and neuronal circadian networks. Using fluorescent transcriptional reporters in a Drosophila ex vivo brain culture system, we identified a reciprocal negative regulation between the master circadian regulator CLK and expression of pdf, the main circadian neuropeptide. We show that PDF feedback is required for maintaining normal oscillation pattern in CLK-driven transcription. Interestingly, we found that CLK and neuronal firing suppresses pdf transcription, likely through a common pathway involving the transcription factors DHR38 and SR, establishing a direct link between electric activity and the circadian system. In sum, our work provides evidence for the existence of an uncharacterized CLK-PDF feedback loop that tightly wraps together the molecular oscillator with the circadian neuronal network in Drosophila.},

This has potential implications for marine ecosystems, notably phytoplankton growth, biomass, and composition. Fifteen years (1997–2012) of year-round size fractionated chlorophyll a (Chl a), phytoplankton pigment fingerprinting and environmental data were analyzed to identify the relationship between sea ice cover, water column stability and phytoplankton dynamics in northern Marguerite Bay, Antarctica. Over the investigated period, both summer (December–February) and winter biomass declined significantly, 38.5\% and 33.3\% respectively. Winter phytoplankton biomass was low ({\textless} 0.25 μg Chl a L−1) and consisted on average of 69\% diatoms, 5\% cryptophytes, and 20\% haptophytes. Summers following winters with low ({\textless} 65 days) sea ice cover were characterized by decreased stratification strength and relatively low (median {\textless} 4.4 μg Chl a L−1) phytoplankton biomass, as compared to summers preceded by high winter sea ice cover. In addition, the summertime microphytoplankton ({\textgreater} 20 μm) fraction was strongly decreased in the low biomass years, from 92\% to 39\%, coinciding with a smaller diatom fraction in favor of nanophytoplankton ({\textless} 20 μm), represented by cryptophytes and haptophytes. In contrast, diatoms dominated ({\textgreater} 95\%) during summers with average-to-high biomass. We advance a conceptual model whereby low winter sea ice cover leads to low phytoplankton biomass and enhanced proportions of nanophytoplankton, when this coincides with reduced stratification during summer. These changes are likely to have a strong effect on the entire Antarctic marine food web, including krill biomass, and distribution.},

	abstract = {Summary
The patterning of social acoustic signaling at multiple timescales, from day-night rhythms to acoustic temporal properties, enhances sender-receiver coupling and reproductive success [1–8]. In diurnal birds, the nocturnal production of melatonin, considered the major vertebrate timekeeping hormone [9, 10], suppresses vocal activity but increases song syllable duration over circadian and millisecond timescales, respectively [11, 12]. Comparable studies are lacking for nocturnal vertebrates, including many teleost fish species that are also highly vocal during periods of reproduction [4, 13–20]. Utilizing continuous sound recordings, light cycle manipulations, hormone implants, and in situ hybridization, we demonstrate in a nocturnally breeding teleost fish that (1) courtship vocalization exhibits an endogenous circadian rhythm under constant dark conditions that is suppressed under constant light, (2) exogenous delivery of a melatonin analog under inhibitory constant light conditions rescues courtship vocal activity as well as the duration of single calls, and (3) melatonin receptor 1b is highly expressed in evolutionarily conserved neuroendocrine and vocal-acoustic networks crucial for patterning reproductive and vocal behaviors in fishes and tetrapods. Our findings, together with those in birds, show melatonin’s remarkable versatility as a timing signal in distantly related lineages. It exerts opposing effects on vocalization in nocturnal versus diurnal species at the circadian timescale but comparable effects at the finer timescale of acoustic features. We propose that melatonin’s separable effects at different timescales depends on its actions within distinct neural networks that control circadian rhythms, reproduction, and vocalization, which may be selected upon over evolutionary time as dissociable modules to pattern and coordinate social behaviors.

The genome of Daphnia pulex, the only crustacean genome available for public use, provides a unique resource for identifying putative circadian proteins in this species. Here, the Daphnia genome was mined for putative circadian protein genes using Drosophila melanogaster queries. The sequences of core clock (e.g. CLOCK, CYCLE, PERIOD, TIMELESS and CRYPTOCHROME 2), clock input (CRYPTOCHROME 1) and clock output (PIGMENT DISPERSING HORMONE RECEPTOR) proteins were deduced. Structural analyses and alignment of the Daphnia proteins with their Drosophila counterparts revealed extensive sequence conservation, particularly in functional domains. Comparisons of the Daphnia proteins with other sequences showed that they are, in most cases, more similar to homologs from other species, including vertebrates, than they are to those of Drosophila. The presence of both CRYPTOCHROME 1 and 2 in Daphnia suggests the organization of its clock may be more similar to that of the butterfly Danaus plexippus than to that of Drosophila (which possesses CRYPTOCHROME 1 but not CRYPTOCHROME 2). These data represent the first description of a putative circadian system from any crustacean, and provide a foundation for future molecular, anatomical and physiological investigations of circadian signaling in Daphnia.},

	abstract = {Summary
Iron is an essential nutrient for phytoplankton, but low concentrations limit primary production and associated atmospheric carbon drawdown in large parts of the world’s oceans [1, 2]. Lithogenic particles deriving from aeolian dust deposition, glacial runoff, or river discharges can form an important source if the attached iron becomes dissolved and therefore bioavailable [3–5]. Acidic digestion by zooplankton is a potential mechanism for iron mobilization [6], but evidence is lacking. Here we show that Antarctic krill sampled near glacial outlets at the island of South Georgia (Southern Ocean) ingest large amounts of lithogenic particles and contain 3-fold higher iron concentrations in their muscle than specimens from offshore, which confirms mineral dissolution in their guts. About 90\% of the lithogenic and biogenic iron ingested by krill is passed into their fecal pellets, which contain ∼5-fold higher proportions of labile (reactive) iron than intact diatoms. The mobilized iron can be released in dissolved form directly from krill or via multiple pathways involving microbes, other zooplankton, and krill predators. This can deliver substantial amounts of bioavailable iron and contribute to the fertilization of coastal waters and the ocean beyond. In line with our findings, phytoplankton blooms downstream of South Georgia are more intensive and longer lasting during years with high krill abundance on-shelf. Thus, krill crop phytoplankton but boost new production via their nutrient supply. Understanding and quantifying iron mobilization by zooplankton is essential to predict ocean productivity in a warming climate where lithogenic iron inputs from deserts, glaciers, and rivers are increasing [7–10].},

We report that {\textgreater}40\% of the transcriptome exhibits rhythmic gene expression, and that depending on the specific tidal conditions, between 80\% and 90\% of the rhythmic transcripts follow a circadian expression pattern with a period of 24 to 26 h. Consistent with the dominant effect of the circadian cycle we show that the expression of clock genes oscillates with a 24-h period. Our data indicate that the circadian 24-h cycle is the dominant driver of rhythmic gene expression in this intertidal inhabitant despite the profound environmental and physiological changes associated with aerial exposure during tidal emergence.},

Irrespective of whether the rats had been kept on a daytime or nighttime feeding schedule, the rhythms of maltase and leucine aminopeptidase persisted when the animals were starved. However, the amplitude of the leucine aminopeptidase rhythm began to decrease from the first day of fasting, while that of maltase did not. Conspicuous rhythms persisted for at least 2 days during fasting, but they gradually became vague and disappeared after 5 days. When rats were refed after fasting, the leucine aminopeptidase activity increased within a few hours, but the maltase activity did not. It is suggested that the rhythms of the digestive enzymes in the small intestine of rats are not a direct consequence of food intake, but are triggered off by the anticipatory mechanism which operates when rats expect to be fed. The rhythmic change of leucine aminopeptidase seemed to be intensifed by food intake.},

The mechanism of the FEO might depend on digestive and endocrine processes regulating energy balance. The present study characterizes the dynamics of circulating corticosterone, insulin, and glucagon and regulatory parameters of liver metabolism in rats under restricted feeding schedules. With respect to ad libitum controls, food-restricted rats showed 1) an increase in corticosterone and glucagon and a decrease in insulin before food access, indicating a predominant catabolic state; and 2) a reduction in lactate-to-pyruvate and β-hydroxybutyrate-to-acetoacetate ratios, indicating an oxidized cytoplasmic and mitochondrial redox state in the liver metabolism. All these changes were reversed after feeding. Moreover, liver energy charge in food-restricted rats did not show a significant modification before feeding, despite an increase in adenine nucleotides, but showed an important decrease after food intake. Variations detected in the liver of food-restricted rats are different from those prevailing under 24-h fasting. These observations suggest “anticipatory activity” of the liver metabolism to optimize the processing of nutrients to daily feeding. Data also suggest a possible relationship of the liver and endocrine signals with the FEO.},

The sheephead wrasse Pimelometopon pulchrum does not remove urchins from their shelters, but will attack and consume urchins placed in normal feeding locations during the daytime. The active periods of the sheephead and the urchin do not overlap; urchins begin foraging about 20 min after the diurnal sheephead retire in the evening and return to their shelters 1 to 2 h before sheephead resume feeding in the morning. We infer that the urchin's daytime crevice-dwelling and nocturnal foraging habits have evolved as a response to sheephead predation.

Here we demonstrate a robust circadian rhythm in Drosophila in electrophysiological responses to two classes of olfactory stimuli. These rhythms are observed in wild-type flies during light–dark cycles and in constant darkness, but are abolished in per or tim null-mutant flies (per01 and tim01) which lack rhythms in adult emergence and locomotor behaviour. Olfactory rhythms are also abolished in the per 7.2:2 transgenic line in which per expression is restricted to the lateral neurons of the optic lobe. Because per 7.2:2 flies do not express per in peripheral oscillators, our results provide evidence that peripheral circadian oscillators are necessary for circadian rhythms in olfactory responses. As olfaction is essential for food acquisition, social interactions and predator avoidance in many animals, circadian regulation of olfactory systems could have profound effects on the behaviour of organisms that rely on this sensory modality.},

This study presents evidence from the field in south–central Chile that juvenile Orchestoidea tuberculata Nicolet show crepuscular activity peaks, contrasting with the nocturnal peaks shown by adult conspecifics. Under constant conditions in the laboratory, both juveniles and adults exhibit endogenous rhythms of circadian periodicity. However, the phasing of activity differs in juveniles and adults, corresponding to the differences observed in the field. It is suggested that differing phasing of peak locomotor activity may be a mechanism to reduce contact between juvenile and adult talitrids.

We assume that the location and suitability of habitat is determined by both food availability and three-dimensional complexity of the sea ice. A comparison of the combined area of these regions under current conditions with a warm climate scenario indicates that while total areal sea ice extent decreases, there is a consistently larger area of potential larval krill habitat under warm conditions. These findings suggest that decreases in sea ice extent may not necessarily be detrimental for krill populations.},

	abstract = {Investigations of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) over the last 40 years have examined almost every aspect of the biology of these ecologically important animals. Various elements of krill biology have been brought together to provide concepts of how this species interacts with its environment, but there have been few recent attempts to generate a generalized conceptual model of its life history. In this article I present such a model, based on previous descriptions, observations, and recent data from the scientific literature. This model takes into account a range of findings on krill biology and on the relationships between Antarctic krill and its biotic and abiotic environment. Krill life history is thus viewed as an evolved product of interactions between the species and its environment. The model places particular emphasis on the different forces that act on the larval and adult stages, and on the interaction between krill behavior, systems of ocean currents, and sea ice.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Knowledge of relationships between prey availability and predator performance is the key to using predators as indicators of the state of marine systems and to assessing potential consequences of competition between natural predators and man for common resources. Fluctuations in the abundance of Antarctic krill are believed to have a substantial influence on the reproductive performance of krill-dependent top predator species in the Southern Ocean; few quantifications of such interactions exist. At South Georgia, for 2 years in which acoustic surveys revealed a major difference in krill abundance, we compared diet, provisioning of offspring and breeding success in 4 main predator species (2 penguins, 2 albatrosses, with supporting data from Antarctic fur seal) whose dependence on krill typically ranges from 20 to 90\%. The 4-fold difference in krill biomass between 1986 (ca 30 g m-2) and 1994 (ca 7 g m-2) was accompanied by (1) an 88 to 90\% reduction in the mass of krill in predator diets (and some increase in the fish component), (2) greater prey diversity for most species, (3) reduced diet overlap between species and (4) a switch from krill to amphipods in macaroni penguin but no major dietary change in other species. Rates of provisioning of offspring decreased by 90\% in gentoo penguin and 40 to 50\% in the other 3 species; this was due to reduced meal size in penguins (by 90\% in gentoo and 50\% in macaroni) and to doubling of foraging trip duration in albatrosses. Breeding success was reduced by 50\% in grey-headed albatross (the species least dependent on krill), by 90\% in black-browed albatross and gentoo penguin (only 3 to 4\% of eggs producing fledged chicks) but by only 10\% in macaroni penguin, presumably reflecting its ability to switch to small prey unprofitable for the other species. However, all species (except for black-browed albatross), particularly macaroni penguin, produced fledglings significantly lighter than usual, probably affecting their subsequent survival. Some effects on adult survival could also be inferred. Our results show a coherent, though complex, pattern of within and between species similarities and differences. These mainly reflect the degree of dependence on krill, the feasibility of taking alternative prey and constraints on trip duration and/or meal size imposed by foraging adaptations (especially relating to travel speeds and diving abilities, whereby flightless divers and pelagic foragers differ markedly). The generality of these principles are explored through comparison with other studies, particularly of Shetland seabirds.},

Although the molecular basis of circadian rhythms regulating daily activities is well defined, the molecular basis for the photoperiodic regulation of seasonal activities is largely unknown. We use geographic variation in the photoperiodic control of diapause in the pitcher-plant mosquito Wyeomyia smithii to create the first QTL map of photoperiodism in any animal. For critical photoperiod (CPP), we detect QTL that are unique, a QTL that is sex linked, QTL that overlap with QTL for stage of diapause (SOD), and a QTL that interacts epistatically with the circadian rhythm gene, timeless. Results presented here confirm earlier studies concluding that CPP is under directional selection over the climatic gradient of North America and that the evolution of CPP is genetically correlated with SOD. Despite epistasis between timeless and a QTL for CPP, timeless is not located within any detectable QTL, indicating that it plays an ancillary role in the evolution of photoperiodism in W. smithii. Finally, we highlight one region of the genome that includes loci contributing to CPP, SOD, and hormonal regulation of development.},

A current meter and CTD was associated with the acoustic mooring and a shore-based webcam monitored ice conditions in the fjord. The continuous measurements were supplemented with intermittent krill sampling campaigns and their physical and biological environment. The krill carried out diel vertical migration (DVM) throughout the winter, regardless of the distribution of potential prey. The fjord froze over in mid-winter and the daytime distribution of a mid-water SL of krill immediately became shallower associated with snow fall after freezing, likely related to reduction of light intensities. Still, a fraction of the population always descended all the way to the bottom, so that the krill population by day seemed to inhabit waters with light levels spanning up to six orders of magnitude. Deep-living krill ascended in synchrony with the rest of the population in the afternoon, but individuals consistently reappeared in near-bottom waters already {\textless}1 h after the ascent. Thereafter, the krill appeared to undertake asynchronous migrations, with some krill always being present in near-bottom waters even though the entire population appeared to undertake DVM.},

	abstract = {Summary
Persistent free-running circannual (approximately year-long) rhythms have evolved in animals to regulate hormone cycles, drive metabolic rhythms (including hibernation), and time annual reproduction. Recent studies have defined the photoperiodic input to this rhythm, wherein melatonin acts on thyrotroph cells of the pituitary pars tuberalis (PT), leading to seasonal changes in the control of thyroid hormone metabolism in the hypothalamus. However, seasonal rhythms persist in constant conditions in many species in the absence of a changing photoperiod signal, leading to the generation of circannual cycles. It is not known which cells, tissues, and pathways generate these remarkable long-term rhythmic processes. We show that individual PT thyrotrophs can be in one of two binary states reflecting either a long (EYA3+) or short (CHGA+) photoperiod, with the relative proportion in each state defining the phase of the circannual cycle. We also show that a morphogenic cycle driven by the PT leads to extensive re-modeling of the PT and hypothalamus over the circannual cycle. We propose that the PT may employ a recapitulated developmental pathway to drive changes in morphology of tissues and cells. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the circannual timer may reside within the PT thyrotroph and is encoded by a binary switch timing mechanism, which may regulate the generation of circannual neuroendocrine rhythms, leading to dynamic re-modeling of the hypothalamic interface. In summary, the PT-ventral hypothalamus now appears to be a prime structure involved in long-term rhythm generation.},

	abstract = {Adaptation to the environment is essential for survival, in all wild animal species seasonal variation in temperature and food availability needs to be anticipated. This has led to the evolution of deep-rooted physiological cycles, driven by internal clocks, which can track seasonal time with remarkable precision. Evidence has now accumulated that a seasonal change in thyroid hormone (TH) availability within the brain is a crucial element. This is mediated by local control of TH-metabolising enzymes within specialised ependymal cells lining the third ventricle of the hypothalamus. Within these cells, deiodinase type 2 enzyme is activated in response to summer day lengths, converting metabolically inactive thyroxine (T4) to tri-iodothyronine (T3). The availability of TH in the hypothalamus appears to be an important factor in driving the physiological changes that occur with season. Remarkably, in both birds and mammals, the pars tuberalis (PT) of the pituitary gland plays an essential role. A specialised endocrine thyrotroph cell (TSH-expressing) is regulated by the changing day-length signal, leading to activation of TSH by long days. This acts on adjacent TSH-receptors expressed in the hypothalamic ependymal cells, causing local regulation of deiodinase enzymes and conversion of TH to the metabolically active T3. In mammals, the PT is regulated by the nocturnal melatonin signal. Summer-like melatonin signals activate a PT-expressed clock-regulated transcription regulator (EYA3), which in turn drives the expression of the TSHβ sub-unit, leading to a sustained increase in TSH expression. In this manner, a local pituitary timer, driven by melatonin, initiates a cascade of molecular events, led by EYA3, which translates to seasonal changes of neuroendocrine activity in the hypothalamus. There are remarkable parallels between this PT circuit and the photoperiodic timing system used in plants, and while plants use different molecular signals (constans vs EYA3) it appears that widely divergent organisms probably obey a common set of design principles.},

	abstract = {The visual, olfactory, auditory and gustatory systems of invertebrates are often used as models to study the transduction, transmission and processing of information in nervous systems, and in recent years have also provided powerful models of neural plasticity. This Research Topic presents current views on plasticity and its mechanisms in invertebrate sensory systems at the cellular, molecular and network levels, approached from both physiological and morphological perspectives. Plasticity in sensory systems can be activity- dependent, or occur in response to changes in the environment, or to endogenous stimuli. Plastic changes have been reported in receptor neurons, but are also known in other cell types, including glial cells and sensory interneurons. Also reported are dynamic changes among neuronal circuits involved in transmitting sensory stimuli and in reorganizing of synaptic contacts within a particular sensory system. Plastic changes within sensory systems in invertebrates can also be reported during development, after injury and after short or long- term stimulation. All these changes occur against an historical backdrop which viewed invertebrate nervous systems as largely hard-wired, and lacking in susceptibility especially to activity-dependent changes. This Research Topic examines how far we have moved from this simple view of simple brains, to the realization that invertebrate sensory systems exhibit all the diversity of plastic changes seen in vertebrate brains, but among neurons in which such changes can be evaluated at single-cell level.},

Despite decades of study and broad public interest, we know little about the genetic basis of these hallmark traits. Here we uncover the history of the monarch’s evolutionary origin and global dispersal, characterize the genes and pathways associated with migratory behaviour, and identify the discrete genetic basis of warning colouration by sequencing 101 Danaus genomes from around the globe. The results rewrite our understanding of this classic system, showing that D. plexippus was ancestrally migratory and dispersed out of North America to occupy its broad distribution. We find the strongest signatures of selection associated with migration centre on flight muscle function, resulting in greater flight efficiency among migratory monarchs, and that variation in monarch warning colouration is controlled by a single myosin gene not previously implicated in insect pigmentation.

	abstract = {The Antarctic krill Euphausia superba experiences almost all marine photic environments throughout its life cycle. Antarctic krill eggs hatch in the aphotic zone up to 1000 m depth and larvae develop on their way to the ocean surface (development ascent) and are exposed to different quality (wavelength) and quantity (irradiance) of light. Adults show a daily vertical migration pattern, moving downward during the day and upward during the night within the top 200 m of the water column. Seawater acts as a potent chromatic filter and animals have evolved different opsin photopigments to perceive photons of specific wavelengths. We have investigated the transcriptome of E. superba and, using a candidate gene approach, we identified six novel opsins. Five are r-type visual opsins: four middle-wavelength-sensitive (EsRh2, EsRh3, EsRh4 and EsRh5) and one long-wavelength-sensitive (EsRh6). Moreover, we have identified a non-visual opsin, the EsPeropsin. All these newly identified opsin genes were significantly expressed in compound eyes and brain, while only EsPeropsin and EsRh2 were clearly detected also in the abdomen. A temporal modulation in the transcription of these novel opsins was found, but statistically significant oscillations were only observed in EsRrh3 and EsPeropsin. Our results contribute to the dissection of the complex photoreception system of E. superba, which enables this species to respond to the daily and seasonal changes in irradiance and spectral composition in the Southern Ocean.},

	abstract = {The determinants of the structure, functioning and resilience of pelagic ecosystems across most of the polar regions are not well known. Improved understanding is essential for assessing the value of biodiversity and predicting the effects of change (including in biodiversity) on these ecosystems and the services they maintain. Here we focus on the trophic interactions that underpin ecosystem structure, developing comparative analyses of how polar pelagic food webs vary in relation to the environment. We highlight that there is not a singular, generic Arctic or Antarctic pelagic food web, and, although there are characteristic pathways of energy flow dominated by a small number of species, alternative routes are important for maintaining energy transfer and resilience. These more complex routes cannot, however, provide the same rate of energy flow to highest trophic-level species. Food-web structure may be similar in different regions, but the individual species that dominate mid-trophic levels vary across polar regions. The characteristics (traits) of these species are also different and these differences influence a range of food-web processes. Low functional redundancy at key trophic levels makes these ecosystems particularly sensitive to change. To develop models for projecting responses of polar ecosystems to future environmental change, we propose a conceptual framework that links the life histories of pelagic species and the structure of polar food webs.},

	abstract = {Author Summary Circadian clocks control daily rhythms in animal, plant and fungal physiology, metabolism and behavior via transcriptional feedback loops. In Drosophila, the CLOCK-CYCLE (CLK-CYC) activator complex binds E-box regulatory sequences to initiate transcription of hundreds of effector genes including their own repressors, PERIOD (PER) and TIMELESS (TIM), which feed back to repress CLK-CYC until they are degraded, thus allowing another cycle of CLK-CYC activation. Although the repression process is critical for the stability and accuracy of circadian timekeeping, how PER-TIM complexes maintain a transcriptionally repressed state for many hours is not well understood. Here we demonstrate that the transcription factor CLOCKWORK ORANGE (CWO) antagonizes CLK-CYC E-box binding, thus enhancing the removal of CLK-CYC from E-boxes to maintain transcriptional repression. This process requires PER, which suggests that PER-TIM and CWO cooperate to maintain a transcriptionally repressed state by removing CLK-CYC from E-boxes. These results demonstrate that PER-TIM requires CWO to effectively repress circadian transcription, and given that circadian transcriptional regulators are well conserved, this mechanism may function to repress transcription in other animals including humans.},

The comparison reveals the presence of transcripts for most of the core members of the phototransduction and circadian networks seen in terrestrial model species in the four marine bivalves. Matches were found for all 37 queried genes, and the expressed transcripts from the deep sequencing data matched 8 key insect and mammalian circadian genes. This demonstrates the high level of conservation of the timekeeping mechanism from terrestrial species to marine bivalves.

	abstract = {(1) This paper describes some of the results of an initial study in 1970/71 of the phytoplankton primary production of the lower basin of Loch Etive, a sea-loch on the west coast of Scotland. (2) Etive is separated from the sea by a narrow entrance and sill at Connel. It is about 30 km long and is further divided into two basins at Bonawe. The lower basin contains an additional sill. The loch has a large catchment area, and the resulting freshwater inflow results in a reduced average salinity in the loch. Current studies show that the loch can be analysed in terms of a two-layer system, mean separation of surface (brackish, seawards flowing) and deep (salty, landwards flowing) layers proceeding at 6-8 km day-1. (3) The upper 10 m of the water column correspond approximately to both the brackish layer and the euphotic zone. Phytoplankton standing crop in this zone of the lower loch ranged from about 7 to about 250 mg C m-3 based on pigment measurements. Cell volume measurements resulted in lower estimates. A high level of standing crop was reached in March and persisted until July/August. (4) Skeletonema costatum was the dominant phytoplankter. Small flagellates were also important. (5) About 70 g C m-2 year-1 is a rough estimate of gross annual primary production in the euphotic zone of the lower basin. A number of factors qualify this value, most important being difficulties in measuring CO2 concentrations, and day-to-day fluctuations in light intensity. (6) It is considered that light is the most important limiting factor in the loch, and that the effects of the wet west highland climate dominate the ecology of the phytoplankton. (7) Comparisons are made with published studies of Loch Ewe, Sween and Striven. The last appears most similar to Etive.},

The key species on the Arctic shelf, the calanoid copepod Calanus glacialis, grows and accumulates lipid reserves in spring and summer in surface waters. The winter is spent in dormancy in deeper water layers with low metabolic activity. As timing and intensity of metabolic changes have been poorly investigated, our study aims to characterize the physiology of C. glacialis over an entire year, from July 2012 to July 2013. We followed anabolic and catabolic enzyme activities and the biochemical composition of this species, taking depth-stratified samples once a month in Billefjorden, a high-Arctic sill fjord. A large part of the population had migrated to depths {\textgreater}100 m by July 2012. Only thereafter, anabolic activities decreased slowly, suggesting that low metabolism is related to ceased feeding rather than to endogenous regulation. During overwintering, anabolic enzyme activities were reduced by half as compared to peak activities in spring. The biochemical composition of the copepods changed little from July to December. Then, the lipid catabolic activity increased and the lipid content decreased, likely fuelling moulting and gonad maturation. The protein content did not change significantly during winter, suggesting that proteins are not much catabolized during that time. The relatively high metabolic activity in C. glacialis in winter suggests that this species is not entering a true diapause and should thus be able to respond flexible to changing environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Mechanistic models are essential tools for interpreting and predicting the consequences of a changing environment and stressors such as pollution on the life histories of marine organisms. Here, we apply the simple and generic energy-budget model DEBkiss to the life history of the marine copepod Calanus finmarchicus. Model modifications were needed to accommodate the copepod life cycle, which deviates in several respects from most other animals (e.g., a sudden stop of growth after the final moult). We identified an acceleration of growth in the early copepodite stages, which could be linked to an increase in the specific feeding rate of the animals. Lipid storage, an essential element of C. finmarchicus biology, was successfully captured with the reproduction buffer of the DEBkiss model. The resulting model was fitted to a detailed data set from the literature and was able to explain growth, development and lipid storage from egg to adult, at different temperatures and food availabilities, within a single consistent framework. The parameterised model could subsequently be used to elucidate the energetic constraints on gonad maturation and reproduction. Interestingly, the overhead costs for egg production seem to be substantially higher than the default value applied in DEB-based studies. The current model provides a solid basis for applications in stress ecology, although our model analysis also identified several knowledge gaps. Specifically, further research is needed to cover the dynamics of diapause and gonad maturation, to explain the dependence of maximum body size on food and temperature, and to verify the predicted high costs for maturity maintenance.},

	abstract = {Diapause (also known as dormancy) is a state of arrested development induced by photoperiod or temperature that allows insects to survive adverse environmental conditions. By regulating diapause induction, the circadian clock is involved in short-day-induced winter diapause but whether this is also the case in long-day (LD)-induced summer diapause remains unknown. The cabbage beetle Colaphellus bowringi could enter summer diapause under LD conditions. However, a non-photoperiodic-diapause (NPD) strain of this species, which was developed in our laboratory by artificial selection, could not enter diapause under LD photoperiod. Therefore, we identified circadian clock genes in this species and measured differences in their expression between a high diapause (HD) strain and the NPD strain to investigate the potential relationship between circadian clock genes and summer diapause induction in C. bowringi. We successfully cloned eight circadian clock genes and obtained intact ORFs of four; cryptochrome2, double-time, shaggy and vrille. Phylogenetic trees and sequence alignment analyses indicated that these circadian clock genes were conserved across insect taxa. The quantitative real-time PCR indicated that clock, cycle, period, timeless, cryptochrome2, and vrille were differentially expressed between HD and NPD strains reared under LD photoperiod during the diapause induction phase. These findings suggest the potential relationship between circadian clock genes and LD-regulated summer diapause induction in C. bowringi.},

Feed intake and growth rates were highest in mid-summer and lowest in autumn. The fact that seasonal cycles persisted under constant photoperiod (12:12 LD) and temperature conditions suggests that circannual rhythms of food consumption and growth exist in the absence of seasonal changes in these environmental cues. The data support the view that seasonal changes in food consumption and growth in the Arctic charr are driven by endogenous rhythms. Reductions in feeding and growth in autumn occurred about 1 month earlier in the maturing males than in the immature fish.

Moreover, the circannual rhythmicity of pupation was not observed under LL after pre-exposure to LD 12:12 for 2 or 4 weeks but was observed after exposure for 8 weeks. Under LL of both light intensities, as the pre-exposure to LD 12:12 was longer, the first pupation peaks occurred earlier and almost synchronized with pre-exposure for 8 weeks with the first peak under continuous LD 12:12. However, the transition from LD 12:12 to LL did not reset the phase of this circannual rhythm.

	abstract = {In many birds, reproduction, molt, migration and other seasonal activities are controlled by endogenous circannual rhythmicity. Under constant conditions, this rhythm persists for many cycles with a period deviating from 12 months. Whether or not the rhythm is expressed depends on day length (photoperiod), which thus represents an important permissive factor in the process of rhythm generation. In nature, circannual rhythms are usually synchronized by the seasonal changes in photoperiod. However, equatorial birds may use daytime light intensity, which changes with the annual cycle of dry and rainy seasons, as a synchronizing zeitgeber. Photoperiod also modulates the rate of progress of the successive phases of the rhythmicity, such that an optimal adjustment to the annual environmental cycle is guaranteed. Populations of a given species may differ in their responsiveness to photoperiod in a manner that can be described as ‘adaptive population-specific reaction norms’. In young migratory songbirds a circannual program determines changes in migratory direction and, at least partly, the time course and distance of migration. This circannual mechanism is replaced or supplemented in older birds by mechanisms formed on the basis of learning and memory. In general, circannual rhythms are intimately involved in the seasonal organization of a bird’s behavior, providing the substrate onto which seasonal environmental factors act.},

	abstract = {Global warming drives changes in oceanographic conditions in the Arctic Ocean and the adjacent continental slopes. This may result in favourable conditions for increased biological production in waters at the northern continental shelves. However, production in the central Arctic Ocean will continue to be limited by the amount of light and by vertical stratification reducing nutrient availability. Upwelling conditions due to topography and inflowing warm and nutrient rich Atlantic Water may result in high production in areas along the shelf breaks. This may particularly influence distribution and abundance of sea mammals, as can be seen from analysis of historical records of hunting. The species composition and biomass of plankton, fish and shellfish may be influenced by acidification due to increased carbon dioxide uptake in the water, thereby reducing the survival of some species. Northwards shift in the distribution of commercial species of fish and shellfish is observed in the Barents Sea, especially in the summer period, and is related to increased inflow of Atlantic Water and reduced ice cover. This implies a northward extension of boreal species and potential displacement of lipid-rich Arctic zooplankton, altering the distribution of organisms that depend on such prey. However, euphausiid stocks expanding northward into the Arctic Ocean may be a valuable food resource as they may benefit from increases in Arctic phytoplankton production and rising water temperatures. Even though no scenario modelling or other prediction analyses have been made, both scientific ecosystem surveys in the northern areas, as well as the fisheries show indications of a recent northern expansion of mackerel (Scomber scombrus), cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and capelin (Mallotus villosus). These stocks are found as far north as the shelf-break north of Svalbard. Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), redfish (Sebastes spp.) and shrimp (Pandalus borealis) are also present in the slope waters between the Barents Sea and the Arctic Ocean. It is assumed that cod and haddock have reached their northernmost limit, whereas capelin and redfish have potential to expand their distribution further into the Arctic Ocean. Common minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus) may also be able to expand their distribution into the Arctic Ocean. The abundance and distribution of other species may change as well – to what degree is unknown.},

Results confirm the existence of a circadian clock in C. gigas. Under entrainment regimes (12-h dark/12-h light photoperiod and tidal cycles simulated by a reversing current flow), oysters exhibited both circadian and circatidal cycles. Under free-running conditions (e.g., continuous darkness), the endogenous rhythm appeared to be circadian. There was no experimental evidence for an endogenous circatidal rhythm, even in oysters just transferred from the field, where a clear tidal cycle was expressed. There are two possible mechanisms to explain tidal behavior in C. gigas: an exogenous tidal cue that drives tidal activity and masks the circadian rhythm and an endogenous circatidal clock that is sensitive to tidal zeitgebers and runs at tidal frequency.},

	abstract = {Although a significant body of literature has been devoted to the chronobiology of aquatic animals, how biological rhythms function in molluscan bivalves has been poorly studied. The first objective of this study was to determine whether an endogenous circadian rhythm does exist in the oyster, Crassostrea gigas. The second objective was to characterize it in terms of robustness. To answer these questions, the valve activity of 15 oysters was continuously recorded for 2 mo in the laboratory under different entrainment and free-running regimes using a high-frequency noninvasive valvometer. The present work demonstrates the presence of a circadian rhythm in the oyster Crassostrea gigas. First, oysters were entrained by 12 L:12 D conditions. Then, free-running conditions (D:D and L:L) indicated that the most frequently observed period ranged from 20 to 28 h, the circadian range. That endogenous circadian rhythm was characterized as weak. Indeed, the period (τ) of the individual animals exhibited high plasticity in D:D and L:L, and the animals immediately followed a 4-h phase advance or delay. Additionally, C. gigas appeared as a dual organism: all oysters were nocturnal at the beginning of the laboratory experiment (January), whereas they were diurnal at the end (March). That shift was progressive. Comparison with a full-year in situ record showed the same behavioral duality as observed in the laboratory: the animals were nocturnal in autumn–winter and diurnal in spring–summer. The significant advantage of a plastic and dual circadian rhythm in terms of adaptability in a highly changing environment is discussed. (Author correspondence: d.tran@epoc.u-bordeaux1.fr)},

Thus, in both the phasing of dark expression and the response to light mPer1 is most similar to the Neurospora clock gene frq.

To understand how light entrains circadian clocks, weexamined the effects of light on a gene known to encode a state variable of a circadian oscillator, the frequency (frq) gene. frq is rapidly induced by short pulses of visible light; clock resetting is correlated with frq induction and is blocked by drugs that block the synthesis of protein or translatable RNA. The speed and magnitude of frq induction suggest that this may be the initial clock-specific event in light resetting. Light induction overcomes frq negative autoregulation so that frq expression can remain high in constant light. These data explain how a simple unidirectional signal (light and the induction of frq) may be turned into a bidirectional clock response (time of day-specific advances and delays). This light entrainment model is easily generalized and may be the common mechanism by which the intracellular feedback cycles that comprise circadian clocks are brought into synchrony with external cycles in the real world.},

We aim to integrate published results about circadian clocks in Drosophila melanogaster while exploring economies of scale in model curation. Clocks govern rhythms of gene-expression that impact fitness, health, cancer, memory, mental functions, and more. Human clock insights have been pioneered in flies. Flies simplify investigating complex gene regulatory networks, which express proteins cyclically using environmentally entrained interlocking feedback loops. Simulations could simplify research further, but currently few models test their quality directly against experimentally observed time series scattered across publications. We designed FlyClockbase for robust efficient access to such scattered data for biologists and modelers, prioritizing simplicity and openness to encourage experimentalists to preserve more annotations and raw-data. Such details could multiply long-term value for modelers interested in meta-analyses, parameter estimates, and hypothesis testing. Currently FlyClockbase contains over 400 wildtype time series of core circadian components systematically curated from 86 studies published between 1990 and 2015. Using FlyClockbase, we show that PERIOD protein amount peak time variance unexpectedly exceeds that of TIMELESS. We hypothesize, PERIOD's exceedingly more complex phosphorylation rules are responsible. Human error analysis improved data quality and revealed significance-degrading outliers, possibly violating presumed absence of wildtype heterogeneity or lab evolution. We found PCR-measured peak time variances exceed those from other methods, pointing to initial count stochasticity. Our trans-disciplinary analyses demonstrate how compilers with more biology-friendly logic could simplify, guide, and naturally distribute biological model curation. Resulting quality increases and cost reductions benefit curation-dependent grand challenges like personalizing medicine.},

Natural variants resulting in differently timed behaviour or physiology, known as chronotypes in humans, have not been well characterized at the molecular level. We sequenced the genome of Clunio marinus, a marine midge whose reproduction is timed by circadian and circalunar clocks. Midges from different locations show strain-specific genetic timing adaptations. We examined genetic variation in five C. marinus strains from different locations and mapped quantitative trait loci for circalunar and circadian chronotypes. The region most strongly associated with circadian chronotypes generates strain-specific differences in the abundance of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II.1 (CaMKII.1) splice variants. As equivalent variants were shown to alter CaMKII activity in Drosophila melanogaster, and C. marinus (Cma)-CaMKII.1 increases the transcriptional activity of the dimer of the circadian proteins Cma-CLOCK and Cma-CYCLE, we suggest that modulation of alternative splicing is a mechanism for natural adaptation in circadian timing.

In bilaterian animals, the circadian clock is intimately involved in regulating energetic metabolism. Although cnidarians exhibit diel behavioral rhythms including cycles in locomotor activity, tentacle extension and spawning, daily cycles in cnidarian metabolism have not been described. To explore a possible circadian metabolic cycle, we maintained the anemone Nematostella vectensis in a 12 h light/dark cycle, a reversed light cycle, or in constant darkness. Oxygen consumption rates were measured at intervals using an optical oxygen meter. Respiration rates responded to entrainment with higher rates during light periods. During a second experiment with higher temporal resolution, respiration rates peaked late in the light period. The diel pattern could be detected after six days in constant darkness. Together, our results suggest that respiration rates in Nematostella exhibit a daily cycle that may be under circadian control and that the cycle in respiration rate is not driven by the previously described nocturnal increase in locomotor activity in this species.},

The location of circadian clock cells in monarch brain has been identified in the dorsolateral protocerebrum (pars lateralis); these cells express PERIOD, TIMELESS, and a Drosophila-like cryptochrome designated CRY1. Monarch butterflies, like all other nondrosophilid insects examined so far, express a second cry gene (designated insect CRY2) that encodes a vertebrate-like CRY that is also expressed in pars lateralis. An ancestral circadian clock mechanism has been defined in monarchs, in which CRY1 functions as a blue light photoreceptor for photic entrainment, whereas CRY2 functionswithin the clockwork as themajor transcriptional repressor of an intracellular negative transcriptional feedback loop. A CRY1-staining neural pathway has been identified that may connect the circadian (navigational) clock to polarized light input important for sun compass navigation, and a CRY2-positive neural pathway has been discovered that may communicate circadian information directly from the circadian clock to the central complex, the likely site of the sun compass. The monarch butterfly may thus use the CRY proteins as components of the circadian mechanism and also as output molecules that connect the clock to various aspects of the sun compass apparatus.},

	abstract = {Genome size varies tremendously both within and among taxa, and strong correlations between genome size and various physiological and ecological attributes suggest that genome size is a key trait of organisms, yet the causalities remains vague. In the present study, we tested how genome size is related to key physiological and ecological properties in five large orders of crustaceans: Decapoda, Cladocera, Amphipoda, Calanoida, and Cyclopoida. These span a wide range in sizes, habitats and life-history traits. To some extent, genome size reflected phylogenetic footprints but, generally, a very wide range in genome size was found within all orders. Genome size was positively correlated with body size in Amphipoda, Cladocera, and Copepoda, but not for Decapoda in general. This could indicate that the evolution of body size occurs mainly by changing cell size for the three first orders, whereas it is more attributed to cell numbers for Decapoda. Cladocera, with direct development and a high growth rate, have minute genomes compared to copepods that possess a more complex life history, whereas, within Decapoda and Amphipoda, developmental complexity is not related to genome size. The present study suggests that, within the crustaceans, selection for a wide variety of life-history strategies has led to widely different genome sizes. © 2009 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2009, 98, 393–399.},

	abstract = {The cnidarian freshwater polyp Hydra sp. exhibits an unparalleled regeneration capacity in the animal kingdom. Using an integrative transcriptomic and stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture proteomic/phosphoproteomic approach, we studied stem cell-based regeneration in Hydra polyps. As major contributors to head regeneration, we identified diverse signaling pathways adopted for the regeneration response as well as enriched novel genes. Our global analysis reveals two distinct molecular cascades: an early injury response and a subsequent, signaling driven patterning of the regenerating tissue. A key factor of the initial injury response is a general stabilization of proteins and a net upregulation of transcripts, which is followed by a subsequent activation cascade of signaling molecules including Wnts and transforming growth factor (TGF) beta-related factors. We observed moderate overlap between the factors contributing to proteomic and transcriptomic responses suggesting a decoupled regulation between the transcriptional and translational levels. Our data also indicate that interstitial stem cells and their derivatives (e.g., neurons) have no major role in Hydra head regeneration. Remarkably, we found an enrichment of evolutionarily more recent genes in the early regeneration response, whereas conserved genes are more enriched in the late phase. In addition, genes specific to the early injury response were enriched in transposon insertions. Genetic dynamicity and taxon-specific factors might therefore play a hitherto underestimated role in Hydra regeneration.},

The highest numbers of differentially expressed genes at the 4×, 20×, and 100× fold-change levels were found between salps collected during spring versus summer 2011 in the WAP (analysis of variance, ANOVA). Spring versus summer samples showed significant differential expression of 77 genes associated with environmental stress response and 51 genes associated with sexual reproduction (paired t tests, p {\textless} 0.05), with significant association between expression of these genes and temperature at the collection site shown by multidimensional scaling analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis identified 41 GO terms responsible for spring versus summer differences, including 156 genes associated with translation (i.e., protein synthesis).

This study reports on a novel exception from the pelagic tunicate Salpa thompsoni Foxton. Oozoids caught off South Georgia and the Antarctic Peninsula generated barcodes consisting of a single prominent DNA sequence with some additional, subtler signals of intra-individual variation. Further investigation revealed this was due to duplicated and/or minicircular DNAs. These could not simply be explained as artefacts or nuclear copies of mitochondrial DNA, but provided evidence for heteroplasmy arising from a dynamic mitochondrial genome. Genetic variation of this sort may allow S. thompsoni to ecologically benefit from asexually driven population blooms without incurring the genetic cost of an excessive mutational load. Analysis of the prominent barcode sequence data yielded low haplotype (h {\textless} 0.61) and nucleotide (π {\textless} 0.0014) diversities, and no evidence for genetic structure between sampling locations as assessed using analysis of molecular variance. These results are consistent with the impact of population blooms and the mixing effect of Southern Ocean currents on S. thompsoni genetic diversity.},

Zooplankton densities were lowest on 22–28 November (ave=61 individuals (ind) m−3), when almost the entire transect was covered by sea ice. By 10–15 January sea surface temperature had increased by ∼2 °C across the transect line, and the study area was ice-free. Total zooplankton abundance had increased to maximum levels for the season (ave=1301 ind m−3; max=1979 ind m−3), dominated by a “Peak Community” comprising Oithona similis, Ctenocalanus citer, Clausocalanus laticeps, foraminiferans, Limacina spp., appendicularians, Rhincalanus gigas and large calanoid copepodites (C1–3). Total densities declined on each subsequent transect, returning to an average of 169 ind m−3 on 10–11 March. The seasonal density decline was due to the decline in densities of “Peak Community” taxa, but coincided with the rise of Euphausia superba larvae into the surface waters, increased densities of Salpa thompsoni, and an increased contribution of C4 to adult stages to the populations of Calanoides acutus, Calanus propinquus and Calanus simillimus. The seasonal community succession appeared to be influenced by the low sea ice extent and southward projection of the ACC in this region. The relatively warm ACC waters, together with low krill biomass, favoured high densities of small grazers during the January/February bloom conditions. The persistence of relatively warm surface waters in March and the seasonal decrease in chlorophyll a biomass provided favorable conditions for salps, which were able to penetrate south of the Southern Boundary.},

	abstract = {Abstract
Salp fecal pellets are rich in organic matter and have been shown to sink at very high velocities. In recent years, salp abundances have been increasing in the Southern Ocean where they seem to be replacing krill as the dominant grazers on phytoplankton. As salps can form large swarms with high pellet production rates, it has been suggested that they will become increasingly important for the vertical export of particulate organic matter in the Southern Ocean. However, detailed studies combining both investigations of pellet production rates, turnover, and export are still needed in order to determine whether salp pellets are important for export (‘sinkers’) or recycling (‘floaters’) of organic matter. Our results suggest that pellets are produced at high rates in the upper few hundred meters of the water column. Although we observed high sinking velocities and low microbial degradation rates of the produced salp pellets, only about one third of the produced pellets were captured in sediment traps placed at 100 m and about {\textasciitilde}13\% of the produced pellets were exported to sediment traps placed at 300 m. The high retention of these fast-settling pellets seems to be caused by break-up and loosening of the pellets, possibly by zooplankton and salps themselves. We measured 3-fold lower size-specific sinking velocities in loosened and fragmented compared to freshly produced intact pellets-. This enhanced the residence times (\&gt;1 day) of both small and large pellets in the upper water column. We postulate that the fragile nature of salp pellets make them more important for recycling of organic matter in the upper mesopelagic layer rather than as a conduit for export of particulate organic matter to the seafloor.},

Despite the ecological importance of this species in Antarctic pelagic food webs and its potential role as an indicator of changing Southern Ocean ecosystems in response to climate change, no genomic resources are available for S. thompsoni or any closely related urochordate species. Using a multiple-platform, multiple-individual approach, we have produced a 318,767,936-bp genome sequence, covering {\textgreater}50\% of the estimated 602 Mb (±173 Mb) genome size for S. thompsoni. Using a nonredundant set of predicted proteins, {\textgreater}50\% (16,823) of sequences showed significant homology to known proteins and ∼38\% (12,151) of the total protein predictions were associated with Gene Ontology functional information. We have generated 109,958 SNP variant and 9,782 indel predictions for this species, serving as a resource for future phylogenomic and population genetic studies. Comparing the salp genome to available assemblies for four other urochordates, Botryllus schlosseri, Ciona intestinalis, Ciona savignyi and Oikopleura dioica, we found that S. thompsoni shares the previously estimated rapid rates of evolution for these species. High mutation rates are thus independent of genome size, suggesting that rates of evolution {\textgreater}1.5 times that observed for vertebrates are a broad taxonomic characteristic of urochordates. Tests for positive selection implemented in PAML revealed a small number of genes with sites undergoing rapid evolution, including genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and metabolic and immune process that may be reflective of both adaptation to polar, planktonic environments as well as the complex life history of the salps. Finally, we performed an initial survey of small RNAs, revealing the presence of known, conserved miRNAs, as well as novel miRNA genes; unique piRNAs; and mature miRNA signatures for varying developmental stages. Collectively, these resources provide a genomic foundation supporting S. thompsoni as a model species for further examination of the exceptional rates and patterns of genomic evolution shown by urochordates. Additionally, genomic data will allow for the development of molecular indicators of key life history events and processes and afford new understandings and predictions of impacts of climate change on this key species of Antarctic pelagic ecosystems.},

Indices have been developed to quantify the timing and intensity of reproduction in Antarctic krill. One finding important to estimates of population fecundity for this long-lived species is that the percent of the population reproducing can vary widely, from 10 to 98\%. Each season was characterized as having delayed, average or advanced ovarian development. In this study we relate these indices to direct and indirect indicators of spring or annual food availability. The timing of the spring sea ice retreat and the extent of sea ice in the spring (September through November) appear to significantly affect the intensity and timing of reproduction in the population. Intensity of reproduction was highest under ?average? conditions, and oöcyte development fastest with conditions of a late retreat and high spring sea ice extent.},

Many aggregate forms with an empty (dead) embryo were observed, and the ratio of newborn solitary forms decreased in autumn, indicating sexual reproduction of the salps was deactivated. The significant reduction in size of mature solitaries suggested that the capacity of asexual reproduction was also reduced in autumn.

	abstract = {The salp Salpa thompsoni has exhibited increased abundance in high latitude portions of the Southern Ocean in recent decades and is now frequently the numerically dominant zooplankton taxon in the Antarctic Peninsula region. The abundance increase of this species in high latitude waters is believed related to ocean warming. Due to its continuous filter feeding and production of dense rapidly sinking fecal pellets S. thompsoni is considered to be an important link in the export of particulate carbon from the surface waters. Hence basic information on the life history of this component of the Antarctic marine ecosystem is essential for assessing its impact given continued climate warming. Here we cover various aspects of the life history of S. thompsoni collected in the north Antarctic Peninsula during annual austral summer surveys of the US Antarctic Marine Living Resources (AMLR) Program between 1993 and 2009. We focus on seasonal and interannual variations in the size composition and abundance of the aggregate (sexual) and solitary (asexual) stages. This information is valuable for refining components of Southern Ocean food web models that explicitly deal with size-structured and life history information on zooplankton. Intraseasonal changes in length–frequency distribution of both stages are used to estimate their growth rates. These average 0.40 mm day−1 for aggregates and 0.23 mm day−1 for solitaries; together these represent ∼7 week and ∼7.5 month generation times, respectively, and a 9 month life cycle (i.e., onset of aggregate production year 1 to aggregate production year 2). Based on the maximum lengths typically found during January–March, the life spans of the aggregate and solitary stages can reach at least ∼5 and ∼15 months, respectively. Length–frequency distributions each year reflect interannual differences in timing of the initiation and peak reproductive output. Interannual differences in the abundance of total salps and proportions of the overwintering solitary stage are significantly correlated with El Niño Southern Oscillation indices (SOI and Nino3.4) prevailing over the previous 2 years. Massive salp blooms result from two successive summers of elevated solitary production following a reversal from La Niña to El Niño conditions. These results indicate the role of basin-scale atmospheric–oceanic processes in establishing optimal conditions that support aggregate and solitary stage reproduction, development and growth.},

	abstract = {AbstractThe diet of Antarctic salps was elucidated by investigating their gut content using automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) and 454-pyrosequencing. Salp samples were collected during the Lazarev Sea Krill Study in the western Weddell Sea (summer 2005–06 and 2007–08, autumn 2004 and winter 2006). Two salp species, Salpa thompsoni and Ihlea racovitzai, both occur in the Southern Ocean and can overlap geographically and seasonally. We provide evidence that, despite the non-selective feeding mechanism, the two co-occurring salp species might have different niches within a habitat. ARISA-patterns of 93 gut content samples revealed strong differences between the two salp species, even at the same sampling site. These differences were confirmed by 454-pyrosequencing of the V4-18S rDNA of ten salps. The pyrosequencing data indicate that flagellates, in particular dinophyceae, constitute a high proportion of the sequence reads identified in the gut content of both salp species. However, within the dinophyceae, differences in the read composition were detected between the two salp species. This supports the findings of a previous study where fatty acid signatures indicate a flagellate-based diet, even though microscopic analyses identified diatoms as the dominant component of salp gut contents.},

The ls-tim mutation in the Drosophila melanogaster clock gene timeless has spread in Europe over the past 10,000 years, possibly because it enhances diapause. We show that the mutant allele attenuates the photosensitivity of the circadian clock and causes decreased dimerization of the mutant TIMELESS protein isoform to CRYPTOCHROME, the circadian photoreceptor. This interaction results in a more stable TIMELESS product. These findings reveal a molecular link between diapause and circadian photoreception.
A recent variant of a circadian clock gene may alter diapause timing in wild European Drosophila, and selection may explain its north-south distribution.

In experiment 1, shrimps maintained under a 12:12 h light/dark (LD) photoperiod were allowed to self-feed using feeders connected to a photoelectric cell, while locomotor activity was recorded with a second photocell. On day 30, animals were subjected to constant darkness (DD) for 12 days to check the existence of endogenous circadian rhythms. In the experiment 2, shrimps were exposed to both a 12:12 h LD photoperiod and a fixed meal schedule in the middle of the dark period (MD, 01:00 h). On day 20, shrimps were exposed to DD conditions and the same fixed feeding. On day 30, they were maintained under DD and fasted for 7 days. The results revealed that under LD, shrimps showed a clear nocturnal feeding pattern and locomotor activity (81.9\% and 67.7\% of total daily food-demands and locomotor activity, respectively, at nighttime). Both feeding and locomotor rhythms were endogenously driven and persisted under DD with an average period length (τ) close to 24 h (circadian) (τ = 24.18 ± 0.13 and 23.87 ± 0.14 h for locomotor and feeding, respectively). Moreover, Shrimp showed a daily food intake under LD condition (1.1 ± 0.2 g day− 1 in the night phase vs. 0.2 ± 0.1 g day− 1 in the light phase). Our findings might be relevant for some important shrimp aquaculture aspects, such as developing suitable feeding management on shrimp farms.},

In Kalanchoë we know about several rhythmic phenomena which are more or less endogenous. Among them are diurnal changes of osmotic values [1], water uptake [1, 2], fresh weight [3], turgor pressure [1], guttation [4], CO2 metabolism [5, 6, 7], acidity [3], phosphatase activity [8], substances active in root growth [3], heat resistance [9, 10], and responsiveness to temperature [11] and light [12 to 19]. All of them have an equal diurnal frequency but not in every case equal phase relations. The opening and closing movements of the flowers, for instance, are mainly due to changes in the turgor pressure of the petals. Therefore, there is a simultaneous oscillation of them coinciding with alternations of the osmotic values and the fresh weight of the flowers. On the other hand, the total acidity of the petals and the water uptake of the flowers oscillate synchronously with the velocity of the flower...},

Thalia democratica dominated in these areas and Salpa fusiformis was abundant at some stations. Salps were distributed only in the upper 200 m of the water column. The maximum abundance of T. democratica was in the surface mixed layer, 0–20 m. S. fusiformis was most abundant from 50 to 75 m. Diel vertical migration was observed only for solitary zooids of S. fusiformis. All other salps appeared only on the surface.

The growth of aggregate zooids of T. democratica was investigated with the time-series sampling during a 28-h sampling period following a drifter. Several cohorts were identified in the length-frequency distributions. The average relative growth rate in length was 8.0\% per hour. Carbon consumption by the T. democratica population, calculated from the derived growth rate, suggested that T. democratica was a major consumer of the primary production in the ring.},

	abstract = {Swarms of the pelagic tunicate, Thalia democratica, form during spring, but the causes of the large interannual variability in the magnitude of salp swarms are unclear. Changes in asexual reproduction (buds per chain) of T. democratica populations in the coastal waters of south-east Australia (32–35°S) were observed in three austral springs (October 2008–2010). T. democratica abundance was significantly higher in 2008 (1,312 individuals m−3) than 2009 and 2010 (210 and 92 individuals m−3, respectively). There was a significant negative relationship (linear regression, r                2 = 0.61, F                1,22 = 33.83, P {\textless} 0.001) between abundance and asexual reproduction. Similarly, relative growth rates declined with decreasing abundance. Generalised additive mixed modelling showed that T. democratica abundance was significantly positively related to preferred food {\textgreater}2 μm in size (P {\textless} 0.05) and negatively related to the proportion of non-salp zooplankton (P {\textless} 0.001). Salp swarm magnitude, growth, and asexual reproduction may depend on the abundance of larger phytoplankton (prymnesiophytes and diatoms) and competition with other zooplankton.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Swarms of the salp \textit{Thalia democratica} periodically occur off southeast Australia following the austral spring bloom of phytoplankton. The present study aimed to determine the abundance and size/stage distribution of \textit{T. democratica} and their relationship with copepods in 3 water types of the western Tasman Sea. Samples were taken from vertical net hauls along 4 cross-shelf transects spaced along 200 km of the New South Wales coast, from the East Australian Current (EAC) sepa­ration zone, around 32.5°S, to off Sydney (34°S). Temperature–salinity signatures grouped stations into 3 distinct water types: inner shelf water, EAC and upwelled water. Although common across all stations, \textit{T. democratica} was significantly more abundant in inner shelf waters compared to both EAC and upwelled water. Analysis of population structure (aggregate buds, aggregate females, aggregate males, immature solitaries and mature solitaries) also identified higher proportions of reproductive ­aggregates and their offspring in inner shelf water. This salp population structure was significantly ­different in the EAC regions, characterised by a paucity of the solitary stages, higher temperatures and lower chlorophyll \textit{a} concentrations. A weak negative correlation was identified between \textit{T. democratica} and copepod abundance. In the present study, the maximum abundance of \textit{T. democratica} was twice the highest globally recorded abundance and 10-fold greater than ­maximum abundances sampled from the continental shelf and slope waters off southeast Australia during the period from 1938 to 1942.},

We find a reproducible pattern of body size-dependence of day and night depths occupied, and of DVM. Both the smallest surface-dwelling and the largest deeper-dwelling copepods refrain from migrations, while intermediate-sized individuals show pronounced DVM. This pattern apparently arises as a consequence of size-dependent predation risk. In the size classes of migratory copepods the amplitude of DVM is further modulated by optical attenuation in the ocean water column because increased turbidity decreases encounter rates with visually hunting predators. Long-term changes in the ocean optical environment are expected to alter the vertical distributions of many copepods and thus to affect predator-prey encounters as well as oceanic carbon export.},

	abstract = {The composition, distribution, abundance, biomass and size structure of mesozooplankton, collected using Bongo nets in the top 300 m layer along a transect between the Antarctic continent and Cape Town, were investigated during the second South African Antarctic Marine Ecosystem Study (SAAMES II) in Jan.–Feb. 1993. Small (\&lt;10 mm) and medium (20–50 mm) size groups of zooplankton consistently dominated across the Southern Ocean. The highest zooplankton densities were recorded at the Antarctic Polar Front (APF) and at the Subtropical Convergence (STC). Minor peaks in zooplankton densities were observed in the southern vicinity of the Subantarctic Front (SAF) and APF. Elevated zooplankton stocks were also found within the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) and the Polar Frontal Zone. The lowest densities were recorded in the permanently open zone (MIZ–APF) and in the Subantarctic zone (SAF–STC). Copepods were generally important along the entire transect and formed the bulk of zooplankton stock within the MIZ and in the Polar Frontal Zone (APF–SAF), accounting for at least 40–95\% of total abundance and biomass. Euphausiids were also a prominent group along the transect. Their contribution was highest (up to 80\% of total biomass) between the MIZ and the APF, mainly because of the occurrence of swarms of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. Tunicates, Pyrosoma sp. and Salpa fusiformis, were found in great numbers only in the region of the STC and further north, while Salpa thompsoni was abundant at the southern boundary of the APF. Chaetognaths dominated samples numerically and by mass in the Subantarctic Zone. Results obtained from cluster and ordination analyses show that zooplankton community structure was well correlated with the position of various biogeographical zones separated by the main frontal systems of the Southern Ocean. Two major groupings of stations, separated by the SAF, were identified in these analyses. This front separated the Antarctic and the subantarctic/subtropical assemblages, confirming its important role as a biogeographical boundary.},

	abstract = {The zooplankton community of the subarctic Pacific is relatively simple, and contains a similar set of major species in all deep water areas of the subarctic Pacific. Their role in the food web varies considerably between coastal and offshore locations. In the oceanic gyres, microzooplankton and other mesozooplankton taxa replace phytoplankton as the primary food source for the dominant mesozooplankton species. Micronekton and larger zooplankton probably replace pelagic fish as major direct predators. Productivity and upper ocean biomass concentrations are intensely seasonal, in part because of seasonality of the physical environment and food supply, but also because of life history patterns involving seasonal vertical migrations (400–2000 m range) and winter dormancy. During the spring–summer season of upper ocean growth, small scale horizontal and vertical patchiness is intense. This can create local zones of high prey availability for predators such as planktivorous fish, birds, and marine mammals. On average, the cores of the subarctic gyres have lower biomass and productivity than the margins of the gyres. There is also some evidence that the Western Gyre is more productive than the Alaska Gyre, but more research is needed to confirm whether this east–west gradient is permanent. There is increasing evidence that the pattern of zooplankton productivity is changing over time, probably in response to interdecadal ocean climate variability. These changes include 2–3 fold shifts in total biomass, 30–60 day shifts in seasonal timing, and 10–25\% changes in average body length.},

	abstract = {Upward-looking acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) (300 kHz) and echosounders (125 kHz) were deployed on moorings at South Georgia to measure abundance of Antarctic krill continuously over several months. Echoes from krill were identified using the theoretical difference in echo intensity at 300 and 125 kHz and scaled to krill density using target strengths appropriate for krill in the region: krill size was determined from diet samples from furseals and penguins foraging near the moorings. A method using water flow past the moorings was developed to convert time-based acoustic observations of krill to area-based abundance estimates. Flow past the stationary moorings was treated analogously to motion along-track of a research vessel through a nominally stationary body of water during a conventional survey. The moorings thus provide a Eulerian view of variation in krill abundance. This is ecologically instructive for South Georgia, where krill are generally passive drifters on currents and where temporal fluctuations in abundance have significant consequences for krill-dependent predators. Moorings were positioned on routine research vessel survey transects, and validity of the mooring method was assessed by comparison of mooring and vessel observations. Krill density estimates from the moorings were not statistically different from vessel estimates in adjacent time periods. A time series of krill density from a mooring revealed step-changes that were not seen during short-term vessel surveys. Moorings deliver data over time scales that cannot be achieved from research vessels and provide insight on environmental factors associated with variation in krill abundance at South Georgia. Mooring data may aid ecosystem-based management.},

	abstract = {Growing interest has developed in acoustic studies about the abundance and distributional patterns of the suspended matter, such as plankton and sediments, that act as sound scatterers for Broadband acoustic Doppler current profiler measurements. Supported by careful calibration procedures, acoustic studies using vertical profiles of echo intensity from moored or vessel-mounted Broadband ADCPs can provide temporal and spatial information, that was previously difficult, if not impossible, to obtain, about the abundance of suspended matter. Moreover, combining these data with the simultaneous ADCP current profiles can lead to more informed, and potentially more insightful, interpretation of the distributional patterns of the plankton and suspended sediments. This interest in applying Broadband and Workhorse ADCPs for purposes that use the backscatter energy measurement motivated RDI to say “Yes, Virginia, you can use a broadband or Workhorse ADCPs to measure absolute and/or relative backscatter coefficient (Sv) using BBADCP data.” This paper describes the calibration steps, performed at the factory and/or by the user that are necessary to estimate Sv, from ADCP data.

By means of diurnally periodic oscillations (the physiological clock) the cell is brought alternately into two period parts with properties differing both quantitatively and qualitatively. Each of these parts lasts approximately eleven to thirteen hours. The basic importance of this oscillation lies in the fact that the cell is thus brought to certain extreme physiological states. Various physiological functions are possible only when these extremes are reached. One of these extreme states is characterized by a high synthetic capacity and the other by a high catabolic capacity. We may illustrate the importance of the oscillator for cellular chemical reactions by means of a diagram (Fig. 1).
Many of these processes (A, B, C, etc.) are already known, and I shall not bother to go over them again now.
If the oscillator is not functioning—that is, if the clock is not running—several of these processes cease or operate at submaximal rate,...},

Among the three genes, kaiC is evolutionarily the oldest, and kaiA is the youngest and likely evolved only in cyanobacteria.

We suggest that the strong UV component of sunlight contributed to the selective pressure for the evolution of the specialized photoreceptor cryptochrome from photolyases involved in DNA repair and propose that early metazoans avoided irradiation by descending in the oceans during the daytime. We suggest further that it is not coincidental that blue-light photoreception evolved in an aquatic environment, since only blue light can penetrate to substantial depths in water. These photoreceptors were then also critical for sensing the decreased luminescence that signals the coming of night and the time to return to the surface. The oceans and the 24-h light–dark cycle therefore provided an optimal setting for an early evolutionary relationship between blue-light photoreception and circadian rhythmicity.},

Transcriptome-, proteome- and metabolome-wide measurements have revealed widespread circadian rhythms in metabolism governed by a cellular genetic oscillator, the circadian core clock. However, it remains unclear if and under which conditions transcriptional rhythms cause rhythms in particular metabolites and metabolic fluxes. Here, we analyzed the circadian orchestration of metabolic pathways by direct measurement of enzyme activities, analysis of transcriptome data, and developing a theoretical method called circadian response analysis. Contrary to a common assumption, we found that pronounced rhythms in metabolic pathways are often favored by separation rather than alignment in the times of peak activity of key enzymes. This property holds true for a set of metabolic pathway motifs (e.g., linear chains and branching points) and also under the conditions of fast kinetics typical for metabolic reactions. By circadian response analysis of pathway motifs, we determined exact timing separation constraints on rhythmic enzyme activities that allow for substantial rhythms in pathway flux and metabolite concentrations. Direct measurements of circadian enzyme activities in mouse skeletal muscle confirmed that such timing separation occurs in vivo.},

	abstract = {Diapause is the classic adaptation to seasonality in arthropods, and its expression can result in extreme lifespan extension as well as enhanced resistance to environmental challenges. Little is known about the underlying evolutionary genetic architecture of diapause in any organism. Drosophila melanogaster exhibits a reproductive diapause that is variable within and among populations; the incidence of diapause increases with more temperate climates and has significant pleiotropic effects on a number of life history traits. Using quantitative trait mapping, we identified the RNA-binding protein encoding gene couch potato (cpo) as a major genetic locus determining diapause phenotype in D. melanogaster and independently confirmed this ability to impact diapause expression through genetic complementation mapping. By sequencing this gene in samples from natural populations we demonstrated through linkage association that variation for the diapause phenotype is caused by a single Lys/Ile substitution in one of the six cpo transcripts. Complementation analyses confirmed that the identified amino acid variants are functionally distinct with respect to diapause expression, and the polymorphism also shows geographic variation that closely mirrors the known latitudinal cline in diapause incidence. Our results suggest that a naturally occurring amino acid polymorphism results in the variable expression of a diapause syndrome that is associated with the seasonal persistence of this model organism in temperate habitats.},

Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize ‘best-practice’ data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Many biological processes, such as cell cycle, circadian clock, menstrual cycles, are governed by oscillatory systems consisting of numerous components that exhibit rhythmic patterns over time. It is not always easy to identify such rhythmic components. For example, it is a challenging problem to identify circadian genes in a given tissue using time-course gene expression data. There is a great potential for misclassifying non-rhythmic as rhythmic genes and vice versa. This has been a problem of considerable interest in recent years. In this article we develop a constrained inference based methodology called Order Restricted Inference for Oscillatory Systems (ORIOS) to detect rhythmic signals. Instead of using mathematical functions (e.g. sinusoidal) to describe shape of rhythmic signals, ORIOS uses mathematical inequalities. Consequently, it is robust and not limited by the biologist's choice of the mathematical model. We studied the performance of ORIOS using simulated as well as real data obtained from mouse liver, pituitary gland and data from NIH3T3, U2OS cell lines. Our results suggest that, for a broad collection of patterns of gene expression, ORIOS has substantially higher power to detect true rhythmic genes in comparison to some popular methods, while also declaring substantially fewer non-rhythmic genes as rhythmic.

However, this prediction was made on the basis of observations from either highly productive ocean margins or ice-covered basins before the recent major ice retreat. We report here a high-resolution survey of sea-surface CO2 concentration across the Canada Basin, showing a great increase relative to earlier observations. Rapid CO2 invasion from the atmosphere and low biological CO2 drawdown are the main causes for the higher CO2, which also acts as a barrier to further CO2 invasion. Contrary to the current view, we predict that the Arctic Ocean basin will not become a large atmospheric CO2 sink under ice-free conditions.
The current carbon dioxide levels in the Arctic Ocean basin will limit further uptake under ice-free conditions.

Detailed knowledge of their community structure and life history traits is a prerequisite to predict their response to ongoing and future climate and anthropogenic changes although winter data is extremely rare. Here data are presented from winter samples (February and April) in four biogeographic regions of the Kara Sea. Comparison of community composition and zooplankton abundance/biomass with data collected during summer showed lower diversity in winter, mainly due to the absence of freshwater species. In contrast to many other northern regions, seasonal biomass differences were relatively small. Year-round high biomass is maintained through a large share of small copepod species and constantly high share of the chaetognath Parasagitta elegans. An advanced state of gonad maturation and reproduction was observed in winter in herbivorous, omnivorous, and carnivorous species, e.g. the copepods Calanus glacialis, Drepanopus bungei, Limnocalanus macrurus, Oithona similis, Pseudocalanus major, Pseudocalanus minutus/acuspes, Paraeuchaeta glacialis, Microcalanus pygmaeus, and euphausiids, hydromedusae, and pteropods. Meroplanktonic larvae of nudibranchia, polychaeta and bivalvia were also registered. Close to the Yenisei mouth, abundance of eggs and larvae of various taxa exceeded older stages. Our data show that the brackish-water zone of the Kara Sea hosts specific communities with omnivorous species efficiently exploiting local resources during the winter and utilizing them for winter reproduction.},

The areal and vertical microzooplankton distributions in the ice and water were compared.

The highest abundances were observed in the bottom 10 cm of the ice cores. The microzooplankton community within the sea ice comprised mainly aloricate ciliates, foraminifers and micrometazoans. In winter, microzooplankton represent an important fraction of the sympagic community in the Antarctic sea ice. They can potentially control microalgal production and contribute to particulate organic carbon concentrations when released into the water column during the ice melt in spring.

Misalignment of an organism's clock with its environment is associated with long-term adverse fitness consequences, as exemplified by the link between circadian disruption and various age-related diseases in humans. Current eukaryotic models of the circadian oscillator rely on transcription/translation feedback loop mechanisms, supplemented with accessory cytosolic loops that connect them to cellular physiology. However, mounting evidence is questioning the absolute necessity of transcription-based oscillators for circadian rhythmicity, supported by the recent discovery of oxidation-reduction cycles of peroxiredoxin proteins, which persist even in the absence of transcription. A more fundamental mechanism based on metabolic cycles could thus underlie circadian transcriptional and cytosolic rhythms, thereby promoting circadian oscillations to integral properties of cellular metabolism.},

	abstract = {Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a key species in the Southern Ocean with an estimated biomass between 100 and 500 million tonnes. Changes in krill population viability would have catastrophic effect on the Antarctic ecosystem. One looming threat due to elevated levels of anthropogenic atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is ocean acidification (lowering of sea water pH by CO2 dissolving into the oceans). The genetics of Antarctic krill has long been of scientific interest for both for the analysis of population structure and analysis of functional genetics. However, the genetic resources available for the species are relatively modest. We have developed the most advanced genetic database on Euphausia superba, KrillDB, which includes comprehensive data sets of former and present transcriptome projects. In particular, we have built a de novo transcriptome assembly using more than 360 million Illumina sequence reads generated from larval krill including individuals subjected to different CO2 levels. The database gives access to: 1) the full list of assembled genes and transcripts; 2) their level of similarity to transcripts and proteins from other species; 3) the predicted protein domains contained within each transcript; 4) their predicted GO terms; 5) the level of expression of each transcript in the different larval stages and CO2 treatments. All references to external entities (sequences, domains, GO terms) are equipped with a link to the appropriate source database. Moreover, the software implements a full-text search engine that makes it possible to submit free-form queries. KrillDB represents the first large-scale attempt at classifying and annotating the full krill transcriptome. For this reason, we believe it will constitute a cornerstone of future approaches devoted to physiological and molecular study of this key species in the Southern Ocean food web.},

	abstract = {The circadian clock is crucial for sustaining rhythmic biochemical, physiological, and behavioral processes in living creatures. In this study, we isolated and characterized two circadian clock genes in Macrobrachium nipponense, period (Mnper) and timeless (Mntim). The complete Mnper cDNA measures 4283 bp in length with an open reading frame encoding 1292 amino acids, including functional domains such as PER-ARNT-SIM (PAS), cytoplasmic localization domain (CLD), TIM interaction site (TIS), and nuclear localization signal (NLS). The deduced Mntim protein comprises1540 amino acids with functional domains such as PER interaction site (PIS), NLS, and CLD. Tissue distribution analyses showed that the two genes were highly expressed in the eyestalk and brain in both males and females, as well as being expressed in the ovary. The expression profiles of Mnper and Mntim were determined in the eyestalk, brain, and ovary under simulated breeding season and non-breeding season conditions. The expression profiles of both Mnper and Mntim appeared to be unaffected in the eyestalk. However, the expression of both genes exhibited significant seasonal variations in the brain, and thus we assumed the brain to be their functional location. The expression profiles under different simulated seasons and the variations during different ovarian stages indicate that both genes might be involved with female reproduction. Especially the mRNA levels in the brain varied greatly during these stages indicating that the clock function in the brain is closely related to ovarian development and female reproduction. And the reproductive roles of clock genes need to be elucidated.},

	abstract = {A multi-scale approach was used to evaluate which spatial gradient of environmental variability is the most important in structuring zooplankton diversity in the West Spitsbergen Current (WSC). The WSC is the main conveyor of warm and biologically rich Atlantic water to the Arctic Ocean through the Fram Strait. The data set included 85 stratified vertical zooplankton samples (obtained from depths up to 1000 metres) covering two latitudinal sections (76°30’N and 79°N) located across the multi-path WSC system. The results indicate that the most important environmental variables shaping the zooplankton structural and functional diversity and standing stock variability are those associated with depth, whereas variables acting in the horizontal dimension are of lesser importance. Multivariate analysis of the zooplankton assemblages, together with different univariate descriptors of zooplankton diversity, clearly illustrated the segregation of zooplankton taxa in the vertical plane. The epipelagic zone (upper 200 m) hosted plentiful, Oithona similis-dominated assemblages with a high proportion of filter-feeding zooplankton. Although total zooplankton abundance declined in the mesopelagic zone (200–1000 m), zooplankton assemblages in that zone were more diverse and more evenly distributed, with high contributions from both herbivorous and carnivorous taxa. The vertical distribution of integrated biomass (mg DW m-2) indicated that the total zooplankton biomass in the epipelagic and mesopelagic zones was comparable. Environmental gradients acting in the horizontal plane, such as the ones associated with different ice cover and timing of the spring bloom, were reflected in the latitudinal variability in protist community structure and probably caused differences in succession in the zooplankton community. High abundances of Calanus finmarchicus in the WSC core branch suggest the existence of mechanisms advantageous for higher productivity or/and responsible for physical concentration of zooplankton. Our results indicate that regional hydrography plays a primary role in shaping zooplankton variability in the WSC on the way to the Arctic Ocean, with additional effects caused by biological factors related to seasonality in pelagic ecosystem development, resulting in regional differences in food availability or biological production between the continental slope and the deep ocean regions.},

Change in diatom concentration had no effect on the rate of filtration. There was some evidence of a diurnal feeding rhythm with greater activity at night. Feeding was most rapid at 8° C., slower at 13° and 3°.(2) Studies on the growth of Calanus supplied with different concentrations of diatoms indicated that the food requirement is less than has been calculated from oxygen consumption measurements. This is also borne out by comparing the amount of particulate organic matter in the sea with the rate of feeding measured in the laboratory.(3) The view that the feeding activity of Calanus is automatic filtering is favored by these experiments.(4) Approximately one-half the organic nitrogen content of Nitzschia is in a form available to Calanus.(5) These results are correlated with the ecology of Calanus as studied in the field.},

Their offspring were reared in the laboratory under several combinations of photoperiod and temperature to assess the diapause response and genetic similarity of the populations. The results indicate that L. aestiva is not genetically homogeneous throughout its range. Differences in the percentage of subitaneous and diapause eggs produced by laboratory-reared and field-collected populations reflected the unique combination of environmental conditions occurring in the geographic regions from which the animals originated. In the Virginian province where planktonic stages of the species are seasonally present, diapause egg production is triggered by short day length photoperiods and cool temperatures. On the other hand in the Carolinian province where the planktonic stages tend to occur year-round diapause eggs are rarely produced by either field-collected females or their laboratory reared offspring. This suggests that most of these animals lack the genetic capacity to produce diapause eggs. Diapause may lead to the reproductive isolation of populations if gene flow is reduced or prevented owing to their separation on a temporal scale.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: The reproductive biology of Calanus finmarchicus was investigated at a permanent station in the Norwegian Sea (Weathership Stn M, 66°N, 2°E) during a time series between March and June 1997. The temporal development of female abundance, egg production rate and gonad development stage in relation to the phytoplankton production cycle is described. Abundance of females, copepodite stage 5 and males as well as female gonad morphology were examined from WP2 net samples taken daily from the upper 100 m. Daily egg production rate and number of spawning females were determined from 50 individual females placed in multiwells or beakers. Once a week a multinet haul from 1000-500-250-100-50-0 m was performed to study the depth distribution of females and gonad development stages. Results show that the reproductive period of C. finmarchicus in the Atlantic region of the Norwegian Sea can be subdivided in 3 periods in relation to phytoplankton development: (1) During the prebloom over a period of 49 d mean egg production rate was 8 eggs female-1 d-1 and an average of 47\% of the females were mature. (2) Coincident with the bloom in mid May the egg production rate increased up to a maximum of 44 eggs female-1 d-1 while more than 80\% of the females were mature. (3) After the bloom at the beginning of June, egg production decreased, and mature females were only rarely found. Feeding experiments indicate that food quantity limited egg production prior to the bloom, while presumably food quality was not sufficient during postbloom. However, due to high female abundance the total population egg production prior to the bloom was the same as during the bloom. This implies that the reproduction of C. finmarchicus in the Norwegian Sea is to some extent decoupled from the phytoplankton bloom.},

The writing of this paper has been influenced by strongly held convictions. This does not concern the validity of the theoretical scheme it offers; it concerns the need at this juncture in the study of “daily” rhythms for bold and explicit theory formation. We are beset rather than blessed with an enormous number of observations about a great diversity of organisms that range from unicellulars through African violets to man. Moreover, the fact that a majority of these observations is highly fascinating is itself a danger—the common danger threatening the biologist of mistaking acquisition of more fascinating facts, and more concrete detail, for analytic progress. To make progress analyzing circadian rhythms we must perceive what the problems are—or rather state what we take them to be—and proceed with accumulation of new information only as it tests, and alas probably eliminates, theory.

Over the vast expanse of the Southern Ocean (SO), the climate is variously predicted to experience increased warming, strengthening wind, acidification, shallowing mixed layer depths, increased light (and UV), changes in upwelling and nutrient replenishment, declining sea ice, reduced salinity, and the southward migration of ocean fronts. These changes are expected to alter the structure and function of phytoplankton communities in the SO. The diverse environments contained within the vast expanse of the SO will be impacted differently by climate change; causing the identity and the magnitude of environmental factors driving biotic change to vary within and among bioregions. Predicting the net effect of multiple climate-induced stressors over a range of environments is complex. Yet understanding the response of SO phytoplankton to climate change is vital if we are to predict the future state/s of the ecosystem, estimate the impacts on fisheries and endangered species, and accurately predict the effects of physical and biotic change in the SO on global climate. This review looks at the major environmental factors that define the structure and function of phytoplankton communities in the SO, examines the forecast changes in the SO environment, predicts the likely effect of these changes on phytoplankton, and considers the ramifications for trophodynamics and feedbacks to global climate change. Predictions strongly suggest that all regions of the SO will experience changes in phytoplankton productivity and community composition with climate change. The nature, and even the sign, of these changes varies within and among regions and will depend upon the magnitude and sequence in which these environmental changes are imposed. It is likely that predicted changes to phytoplankton communities will affect SO biogeochemistry, carbon export, and nutrition for higher trophic levels.},

	abstract = {Diapause is a type of dormancy that requires preparation, typically precedes the onset of unfavorable conditions, and necessitates a period of arrest before development can proceed. Two ecologically important groups of copepods have incorporated diapausing stages into their life histories. In freshwater, estuarine, and coastal environments, species within the Centropagoidea superfamily can produce resting eggs containing embryos that may be quiescent, diapausing, or in some intermediate state. Resting eggs sink into the sediments, remain viable over months to years, and form a reservoir from which the planktonic population is reestablished. In coastal and oceanic environments, copepods within the Calanidae and Eucalanidae families can enter diapause during late juvenile (copepodid) or adult stages. These copepods accumulate large amounts of lipids before they migrate into deep water and diapause for several months. Through respiration, diapausing copepods may sequester more carbon in the deep ocean than any other biogeochemical process, and changes in diapause phenology associated with climate change (particularly reduction in diapause duration) could have a significant impact not only on regional ecosystems, but on global climate as well.},

It is assumed that during diapause C. acutus is neutrally buoyant in order to retain energy reserves otherwise depleted by swimming activities. However, so far, no experimental observations on its buoyancy have been reported and our knowledge of buoyancy regulation mechanisms is incomplete. In the present study, species-specific differences in buoyancy were assessed visually. Observations were made of specimens from the diapausing cohort of C. acutus and compared to another herbivorous copepod Calanus propinquus, which overwinters actively feeding in the upper water layers. Freshly caught copepods were anaesthetized in a 3-amino-benzoic acid ethyl ester (MS222) in seawater solution in order to exclude the influence of swimming movements on buoyancy control. It was shown that C. propinquus was negatively buoyant, whereas diapausing C. acutus remained neutrally buoyant. This is the first record that neutral buoyancy in diapausing copepods is maintained by the biochemical body composition without the additional need of swimming movements.},

However, the triggers of vertical migration and diapause are still far from being understood. In this study, we test the hypothesis that acidic pH and the accumulation of ammonium (NH4+) in the hemolymph contribute to the control of diapause in certain Antarctic copepod species. In a recent study, it was already hypothesized that the replacement of heavy ions by ammonium is necessary for diapausing copepods to achieve neutral buoyancy at overwintering depth. The current article extends the hypothesis of ammonium-aided buoyancy by highlighting recent findings of low pH values in the hemolymph of diapausing copepods with elevated ammonium concentrations. Since ammonia (NH3) is toxic to most organisms, a low hemolymph pH is required to maintain ammonium in the less toxic ionized form (NH4+). Recognizing that low pH values are a relevant factor reducing metabolic rate in other marine invertebrates, the low pH values found in overwintering copepods might not only be a precondition for ammonium accumulation, but in addition, it may insure metabolic depression throughout diapause.},

	abstract = {It is now clear that mitochondrial defects are associated with a large variety of clinical phenotypes. This is the result of the mitochondria's central role in energy production, reactive oxygen species homeostasis, and cell death. These processes are interdependent and may occur under various stressing conditions, among which low oxygen levels (hypoxia) are certainly prominent. Cells exposed to hypoxia respond acutely with endogenous metabolites and proteins promptly regulating metabolic pathways, but if low oxygen levels are prolonged, cells activate adapting mechanisms, the master switch being the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). Activation of this factor is strictly bound to the mitochondrial function, which in turn is related with the oxygen level. Therefore in hypoxia, mitochondria act as [O2] sensors, convey signals to HIF-1directly or indirectly, and contribute to the cell redox potential, ion homeostasis, and energy production. Although over the last two decades cellular responses to low oxygen tension have been studied extensively, mechanisms underlying these functions are still indefinite. Here we review current knowledge of the mitochondrial role in hypoxia, focusing mainly on their role in cellular energy and reactive oxygen species homeostasis in relation with HIF-1 stabilization. In addition, we address the involvement of HIF-1 and the inhibitor protein of F1F0 ATPase in the hypoxia-induced mitochondrial autophagy.},

The master clock maintains phase coherence in peripheral cells through systemic cues such as feeding-fasting and temperature cycles. Here, we examined the role of oxygen as a resetting cue for circadian clocks. We continuously measured oxygen levels in living animals and detected daily rhythms in tissue oxygenation. Oxygen cycles, within the physiological range, were sufficient to synchronize cellular clocks in a HIF1α-dependent manner. Furthermore, several clock genes responded to changes in oxygen levels through HIF1α. Finally, we found that a moderate reduction in oxygen levels for a short period accelerates the adaptation of wild-type but not of HIF1α-deficient mice to the new time in a jet lag protocol. We conclude that oxygen, via HIF1α activation, is a resetting cue for circadian clocks and propose oxygen modulation as therapy for jet lag.},

Lipid contents (primarily wax esters, WE) were highest in overwintering Stage 5 copepodids, and consumption of wax ester stores began approximately 2 mo prior to moulting in situ. The rate of WE use in the in situ population, estimated from changes in WE over time, was 1.5 µg individual-1 d-1, with approximately 28\% of total wax ester reserves used prior to moulting. Loss rates in laboratory incubations ranged from 2.7 to 7.8 µg individual-1 d-1, with 36 to 65\% of total wax ester reserves being used prior to moulting. Protein declined following the moult to adulthood, and was variable in active, surface-dwelling CV copepodids. Measurements of GDH activity were consistent with protein catabolism for actively growing CV copepodids and adults, but not overwintering individuals, which suggests that protein is not an important metabolic substrate during overwintering. Individuals kept in the laboratory moulted in advance of the in situ moulting period, after a 1 to 2 mo post-capture lag. Individuals collected early in the overwintering period postponed moulting relative to individuals collected closer to the time of the in situ moulting period. This suggests that the timing of moulting in N. plumchrus involves an interaction between an endogenous clock and an unknown cue that stimulates the termination of dormancy and the onset of reproductive development and maturation.},

This paper analyses a 17-year time series, 1996-2012, on C. finmarchicus collected within the Atlantic Water mass along the Svinøy transect in the southeastern Norwegian Sea. We use the spring abundance of adult as a proxy for the size of C. finmarchicus’ overwintered population. The inter-annual trend in spring abundance of adult C. finmarchicus in the 200-0 m depth-stratum is assessed while accounting for spring population development to the adult stage represented by day of year for sampling, inter-annual changes in timing of population development, and spatial differences. For the most oceanic stations, a significant inter-annual trend in spring abundance of adult C. finmarchicus was revealed using generalized additive models (GAM). This trend primarily consists in an increase prior to year 2000 and a decrease between years 2000 and ca. 2011. For the stations closer to the coast, the identified inter-annual trend is a decrease during a longer period from the late 90s until ca. 2011. From 2000 to 2011, our estimates suggest a 50\% decrease for the most oceanic stations, and as much as an 81\% decrease for the stations closer to the coast. In addition the results suggest a consistent change in phenology over the years and the stations. The predicted spring peak of overwintered adult population abundance is suggested to become shorter by 3 days, and the predicted maximum of abundance to take place 4 days earlier over the 17 years of the time-series. The results highlight significant changes in intensity and timing of the overwintered population of a key zooplankton species in the Norwegian Sea that may have important implications on the scale of an entire ecosystem.},

The genus Drosophila contains over 2,000 species that, stemming from a common ancestor in the Old World Tropics, populate today very different environments [1, 2] (reviewed in [3]). We found significant differences in the activity pattern of Drosophila species belonging to the holarctic virilis group, i.e., D. ezoana and D. littoralis, collected in Northern Europe, compared to that of the cosmopolitan D. melanogaster, collected close to the equator. These behavioral differences might have been of adaptive significance for colonizing high-latitude habitats and hence adjust to long photoperiods. Most interestingly, the flies’ locomotor activity correlates with the neurochemistry of their circadian clock network, which differs between low and high latitude for the expression pattern of the blue light photopigment cryptochrome (CRY) and the neuropeptide Pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) [4–6]. In D. melanogaster, CRY and PDF are known to modulate the timing of activity and to maintain robust rhythmicity under constant conditions [7–11]. We could partly simulate the rhythmic behavior of the high-latitude virilis group species by mimicking their CRY/PDF expression patterns in a laboratory strain of D. melanogaster. We therefore suggest that these alterations in the CRY/PDF clock neurochemistry might have allowed the virilis group species to colonize high-latitude environments.},

	abstract = {Although some parts of diapause development have been clarified up by endocrinologists, knowledge of the underlying processes remains insufficient. The survey of ecophysiological aspects of diapause development has thus to be limited to inputs and outputs from the blackbox. The terms diapause development, diapause intensity, post-diapause quiescence, horotelic processes of diapause, and tachytelic processes of diapause (reactivation) are defined. Andrewartha's term diapause development has been accepted because it shows diapause as a dynamic event.In about the last 20 years, some views on diapause development have been updated, while others have fossilised. The assumption that chilling is a general prerequisite for completion of diapause development in all insects still survives in part of the scientific community, in spite of much contradictory evidence and often due to inadequate interpretation of experiments (examples given in figures and tables). On the contrary, it has been generally recognised that in temperate climates overwintering diapause is usually already completed in early/mid winter and the dormancy is then temperature quiescence. The conception of multiple pathways of diapause completion postulates that diapause can be completed either by the normal (slow) progress of diapause development (horotelic processes), or by a faster activation (tachytelic processes). There are important differences between the mechanisms regulating activation and the horotelic processes. Thus, e.g., the photoperiodic response is lost during horotelic completion, while after photoperiodic activation it persists. In addition to photoperiodic activation other kinds of activation are being studied, particularly activation by high temperature.Some conclusions can be made from modern studies on diapause development. In every individual, several (at least two) possible pathways exist that are evidently interlinked and mutually complementary. Thus the time of diapause passed at any condition has to be considered, as well as the exposure to very low temperatures. In temperature studies the experimental range ought to be adequately wide and less affected by a priori assumptions. Stimulation by temperature increase or improvement in food or other conditions has to be considered.The success of diapause completion should be measured by at least four parameters: (1) incidence (\%) of developmental steps; (2) duration of delay; (3) synchronization; (4) vigour of post-diapause insects (shown by long-term survival or fecundity). The last two parameters have usually been neglected.},

The mangrove cricket, Apteronemobius asahinai, shows simultaneously two endogenous rhythms in its locomotor activity; the circatidal rhythm generates active and inactive phases, and the circadian rhythm modifies activity levels by suppressing the activity during subjective day. In the present study, we silenced Clock (Clk), a master gene of the circadian clock, in A. asahinai using RNAi to investigate the link between the circatidal and circadian clocks. The abundance of Clk mRNA in the crickets injected with double-stranded RNA of Clk (dsClk) was reduced to a half of that in control crickets. dsClk injection also reduced mRNA abundance of another circadian clock gene period (per) and weakened diel oscillation in per mRNA expression. Examination of the locomotor rhythms under constant conditions revealed that the circadian modification was disrupted after silencing Clk expression, but the circatidal rhythm remained unaffected. There were no significant changes in the free-running period of the circatidal rhythm between the controls and the crickets injected with dsClk. Our results reveal that Clk is essential for the circadian clock, but is not required for the circatidal clock. From these results we propose that the circatidal rhythm of A. asahinai is driven by a clock, the molecular components of which are distinct from that of the circadian clock.},

This study investigated whether horseshoe crabs (1) always express activity rhythms consistent with their natural tides and (2) can alter activity rhythm expression in response to novel tide cycles. Activity rhythms of L. polyphemus from environments with two daily tides (Gulf of Maine, 43°6′N/70°52′W, and Massachusetts, 41°32′N/70°40′W), one dominant daily tide (Apalachee Bay, Florida, 29°58′N/84°20′W), and microtides (Indian River Lagoon, Florida, 28°5′N/80°35′W) were recorded in 2011–2013 during three artificial tide conditions: no tides, a 12.4-h tidal cycle, and a 24.8-h tidal cycle. Interestingly, L. polyphemus from the microtidal site (n = 7) appeared “plastic” in their responses; they were able to express both bimodal and unimodal rhythms in response to different tide cycles. In contrast, the other two populations exhibited more fixed responses: regardless of the tides, they were exposed to, horseshoe crabs from areas with one dominant daily tide (n = 18) consistently expressed unimodal rhythms, while those from areas with two daily tides (n = 28) generally expressed bimodal rhythms. Rhythms expressed by L. polyphemus thus appear to be a function of endogenous clocks, the tidal cues to which individuals are exposed, and tidal cues that individuals experience throughout ontogeny.},

With the increased availability of high-throughput methods for measuring gene expression, whole transcriptome approaches may be increasingly utilized for reference gene selection and validation. In this study, RNA-seq was used to identify a set of novel qPCR reference genes and also to evaluate a panel of traditional "housekeeping" reference genes in two species of the evolutionary model plant genus Mimulus. More broadly, the methods proposed in this study can be used to harness the power of transcriptomes to identify appropriate reference genes for qPCR in any study organism, including emerging and non-model systems. We find that RNA-seq accurately estimates gene expression means in comparison to qPCR, and that expression means are robust to moderate environmental and genetic variation. However, measures of expression variability were only in agreement with qPCR for samples obtained from a shared environment. This result, along with transcriptome-wide comparisons, suggests that environmental changes have greater impacts on expression variability than on expression means. We discuss how this issue can be addressed through experimental design, and suggest that the ever-expanding pool of published transcriptomes represents a rich and low-cost resource for developing better reference genes for qPCR.},

In the bean bug, Riptortus pedestris, circadian genes are essential for mediating photoperiodically-dependent growth of the male accessory glands (MAGs). The present study explores the role of circadian genes and JH receptor in male diapause in the linden bug, Pyrrhocoris apterus. These data indicate that circadian factors Clock, Cycle and Cry2 are responsible for photoperiod measurement, whereas Met and its partner protein Taiman participate in JH reception. Surprisingly, knockdown of the JH receptor neither lowered locomotor activity nor reduced mating behavior of males. These data suggest existence of a parallel, JH-independent or JH-upstream photoperiodic regulation of reproductive behavior.},

By combining oceanographic drift models and statistical analyses of field data from 1959 to 1993 and investigating effects across trophic levels, we are able to elucidate pathways by which climate influences zooplankton. The results show that both chlorophyll biomass in spring and C. finmarchicus biomass in summer relate positively to a combination of shallow mixed layer depth and increased wind in spring, suggesting that C. finmarchicus biomass in summer is influenced by bottom-up effects of food availability. Furthermore, spatially resolved C. finmarchicus biomass in summer is linked to favorable transport from warmer, core areas to the south. However, increased mean temperature in spring does not lead to increased C. finmarchicus biomass in summer. Rather, spring biomass is generally higher, but population growth from spring to summer is lower, after a warm compared with a cold spring. Our study illustrates how improved understanding of climate effects can be obtained when different datasets and different methods are combined in a unified approach.},

During diapause, animals avoid starving in winter by living in deep waters where metabolism is lower and met by lipid reserves. Global warming is therefore expected to shorten the maximum potential diapause duration by increasing metabolic rates and by reducing body size and lipid reserves. This will alter the phenology of zooplankton, impact higher trophic levels and disrupt biological carbon pumps. Here, we project the impacts of climate change on the key North Atlantic copepod Calanus finmarchicus under IPCC RCP 8.5. Potential diapause duration is modelled in relation to body size and overwintering temperature. The projections show pronounced geographic variations. Potential diapause duration reduces by more than 30\% in the Western Atlantic, whereas in the key overwintering centre of the Norwegian Sea it changes only marginally. Surface temperature rises, which reduce body size and lipid reserves, will have a similar impact to deep-water changes on diapause in many regions. Because deep-water warming lags that at the surface, animals in the Labrador Sea could offset warming impacts by diapausing in deeper waters. However, the ability to control diapause depth may be limited.},

Here an endemic copepod species, Calanus glacialis, was used as a model organism, to understand how and why Arctic marine environmental changes may induce biogeographic boundary shifts. A copepod individual-based model was coupled to an ice-ocean-ecosystem model to simulate temperature- and food-dependent copepod life history development. Numerical experiments were conducted for two contrasting years: a relatively cold and normal sea ice year (2001) and a well-known warm year with early ice retreat (2007). Model results agreed with commonly known biogeographic distributions of C. glacialis, which is a shelf/slope species and cannot colonize the vast majority of the central Arctic basins. Individuals along the northern boundaries of this species' distribution were most susceptible to reproduction timing and early food availability (released sea ice algae). In the Beaufort, Chukchi, East Siberian, and Laptev Seas where severe ocean warming and loss of sea ice occurred in summer 2007, relatively early ice retreat, elevated ocean temperature (about 1–2°C higher than 2001), increased phytoplankton food, and prolonged growth season created favorable conditions for C. glacialis development and caused a remarkable poleward expansion of its distribution. From a pan-Arctic perspective, despite the great heterogeneity in the temperature and food regimes, common biogeographic zones were identified from model simulations, thus allowing a better characterization of habitats and prediction of potential future biogeographic boundary shifts.},

The circadian clock is a ubiquitous timekeeping system that organizes the behavior and physiology of organisms over the day and night. Current models rely on transcriptional networks that coordinate circadian gene expression of thousands of transcripts. However, recent studies have uncovered phylogenetically conserved redox rhythms that can occur independently of transcriptional cycles. Here we identify the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), a critical source of the redox cofactor NADPH, as an important regulator of redox and transcriptional oscillations. Our results show that genetic and pharmacological inhibition of the PPP prolongs the period of circadian rhythms in human cells, mouse tissues, and fruit flies. These metabolic manipulations also cause a remodeling of circadian gene expression programs that involves the circadian transcription factors BMAL1 and CLOCK, and the redox-sensitive transcription factor NRF2. Thus, the PPP regulates circadian rhythms via NADPH metabolism, suggesting a pivotal role for NADPH availability in circadian timekeeping.},

	abstract = {The North Atlantic copepods Calanus finmarchicus and C. helgolandicus are moving north in response to rising temperatures. Understanding the drivers of their relative geographic distributions is required in order to anticipate future changes. To explore this, we created a new spatially explicit stage-structured model of their populations throughout the North Atlantic. Recent advances in understanding Calanus biology, including U-shaped relationships between growth and fecundity and temperature, and a new model of diapause duration are incorporated in the model. Equations were identical for both species, but some parameters were species-specific. The model was parameterized using Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey data and tested using time series of abundance and fecundity. The geographic distributions of both species were reproduced by assuming that only known interspecific differences and a difference in the temperature influence on mortality exist. We show that differences in diapause capability are not necessary to explain why C. helgolandicus is restricted to the continental shelf. Smaller body size and higher overwinter temperatures likely make true diapause implausible for C. helgolandicus. Known differences were incapable of explaining why only C. helgolandicus exists southwest of the British Isles. Further, the fecundity of C. helgolandicus in the English Channel is much lower than we predict. We hypothesize that food quality is a key influence on the population dynamics of these species. The modelling framework presented can potentially be extended to further Calanus species.},

	abstract = {Lipid class contents and composition of the copepodite stage CV and adult female Calanus finmarchicus were measured from the autumn to the spring along a transect crossing the Faroe–Shetland Channel. The data give a detailed vertical resolution of lipid content of C. fin-marchicus before, during and after the time of diapause. In the deep water, where C. finmarchicus was in diapause, the wax ester (WE) content did not change between the autumn and spring with the exception of that of females, which showed a significant decrease in lipid content by March. The concentrations of lipids were lower and more variable in both CV and females in surface waters over the sampling period. In March, the lipid concentration of both CV and females decreased significantly with decreasing depth. The triacylglycerol (TAG) content of both CV and females was high in October at all depths but had almost disappeared by December. The TAG was either utilized during this time period or converted to WE. TAG was most prominent in October and again in February in copepods in the upper water column. A simple diagnostic model is presented that estimates how C. finmarchicus allocates energy reserves from lipids into various metabolic functions. The cost of diapause, molting, gonad formation and ascending from depth is estimated based on the time series data. The model indicates that the major portion of the stored lipid goes into gonad formation, in physical ascent and in basic metabolism during ascent, whereas maintenance of diapause and molting is not expensive in terms of lipid utilization.},

	abstract = {The copepod Calanus finmarchicus remains in diapause for up to 5 months in the cold ({\textless}0.5°C) deep ({\textgreater}700 m) waters of the Faroe–Shetland Channel of the north-western approaches to the North Sea. While in diapause, C. finmarchicus has a high lipid content, up to 76\% of dry weight, mostly in the form of wax esters. The question we address here is how copepods with such a high content of buoyant lipids can remain in diapause at depth for an extended period of time? The corollary to this is how this lipid content hinders and/or assists the copepods in their seasonal vertical migration? Part of the answer is due to the physical properties of wax esters. These have a thermal expansion and compressibility higher than that of sea water. Thus, depending on their relative composition (i.e. wax esters/water/protein/chitin), a copepod that is positively buoyant in warm surface waters can become neutrally buoyant in cold deep water. We develop a simple three component physical model of a copepod to explore how and where they attain neutral buoyancy, how the lipid content can aid in their ascent, and what fraction of the lipids can be utilized in ascent in gonad/egg formation while maintaining observed ascent rates. As well as being an energy reserve, the results show that rather than being a barrier to vertical migration, wax esters serve as an important regulator of buoyancy.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: The energetic cost of moulting and gonad maturation from Stage CV to adult has been estimated in the copepods Calanus helgolandicus and C. finmarchicus. For both species, this was done by following 2 laboratory-reared cohorts, one reared at a high food concentration (Cohort H) and the other at a comparatively lower food concentration (Cohort L). The 2 cohorts of each species were maintained at a constant temperature (15°C for C. helgolandicus and {\textasciitilde}8°C for C. finmarchicus). The wax ester (WE) content was estimated in late CV and new moulted females, on the day when approximately 40 to 50\% of the individuals of the cohort had moulted to adulthood. Copepodite Stage CV in Cohort H had accumulated much more WE than those in Cohort L (2.2 and 1.4 times more in the case of C. helgolandicus and C. finmarchicus, respectively). However, for both species, the amount of WE catabolized during the moulting of the CV stage from Cohort H is very similar to that of CV from Cohort L. In both cohorts, it is equivalent to {\textasciitilde}20 µgC for C. helgolandicus and {\textasciitilde}40 µgC for C. finmarchicus. Because of the difficulty of properly estimating the WE content at the end of CV, we consider that our values are underestimates, and a subsequent analysis, which considers the upper range of the WE content estimated at the end of CV, suggests values up to {\textasciitilde}30 µgC for C. helgolandicus and {\textasciitilde}70 µgC for C. finmarchicus. This WE catabolism is mainly due to gonad maturation, which occurred at this time, although part of it is also due to the loss of the exoskeleton and the energy required for the moulting process. We propose that the values obtained in this study can be used as a threshold to determine those animals that can descend for overwintering and those that have to remain at the surface, because the CVs with a WE storage below the threshold value will not be able to support the additional energetic costs linked to the overwintering strategy. Therefore, in the field, the percentage of copepods going into overwintering would be a consequence of the growth conditions. The WE threshold is likely to vary with temperature (with a lower value at higher temperature) since metabolism is more rapid at higher temperature.},

Under nutrient-replete conditions, T. weissflogii grew rapidly in the upper layer of the tank and cells exhibited nearly neutral buoyancy. Cells sank, however, after depletion of ambient nitrate. The growth and sinking of cells were well described by a simple model with nitrate-dependent growth and sinking terms. The best fit was obtained by describing the sinking response with a sigmoid function, where the time scale for increased sinking was 25 h after nitrate depletion. Smaller-scale batch culture experiments showed changes that were consistent with increased sinking upon depletion of nitrate: carbohydrate per ml of culture increased 2- to 5-fold over 3.5 d, while protein per ml did not change significantly. After re-introduction of nitrate into the medium, carbohydrate:protein ratios reverted to their original values. Calculations show that intracellular density and cell sinking rate should change substantially due to fluctuations in carbohydrate and that increased ballast of carbohydrate was sufficient to cause the sinking observed in the tank. Changes in the buoyancy of small (15 um) diatoms such as T. weissflogii in response to changes in nutrient status have important ecological and biogeochemical implications. Nutrient-dependent changes in sinking rates can result in increased residence time of cells in the mixed layer of the ocean, and in enhanced transport of deep nutrients to the euphotic zone uncoupled from inputs of inorganic carbon.},

In higher plants, many clock components have been identified and cellular rhythmicity is thought to be driven by a complex transcriptional feedback circuitry. In the small genome of the green unicellular alga Ostreococcus tauri, two of the master clock genes Timing of Cab expression1 (TOC1) and Circadian Clock-Associated1 (CCA1) appear to be conserved, but others like Gigantea or Early-Flowering4 are lacking. Stably transformed luciferase reporter lines and tools for gene functional analysis were therefore developed to characterize clock gene function in this simple eukaryotic system. This approach revealed several features that are comparable to those in higher plants, including the circadian regulation of TOC1, CCA1, and the output gene Chlorophyll a/b Binding under constant light, the relative phases of TOC1/CCA1 expression under light/dark cycles, arrhythmic overexpression phenotypes under constant light, the binding of CCA1 to a conserved evening element in the TOC1 promoter, as well as the requirement of the evening element for circadian regulation of TOC1 promoter activity. Functional analysis supports TOC1 playing a central role in the clock, but repression of CCA1 had no effect on clock function in constant light, arguing against a simple TOC1 /CCA1 one-loop clock in Ostreococcus. The emergence of functional genomics in a simple green cell with a small genome may facilitate increased understanding of how complex cellular processes such as the circadian clock have evolved in plants.},

We also compared the calculated excess density of filaments with direct measurements of filament density in gradients of percoll. the results clearly demonstrated that increased density resulted from the loss of gas vacuoles. Small variations in density could be attributed to changes in protein and carbohydrate but these would not have caused a loss of buoyancy in the absence of a decrease in gas vacuole content.

They consist of networks of genes and proteins interacting so as to generate biochemical oscillations with a period close to 24 hours. Circadian clocks synchronize to the day/night cycle through the year principally by sensing ambient light. Depending on the weather, the perceived light intensity can display large fluctuations within the day and from day to day, potentially inducing unwanted resetting of the clock. Furthermore, marine organisms such as microalgae are subjected to dramatic changes in light intensities in the water column due to streams and wind. We showed, using mathematical modelling, that the green unicellular marine alga Ostreococcus tauri has evolved a simple but effective strategy to shield the circadian clock from daylight fluctuations by localizing coupling to the light during specific time intervals. In our model, as in experiments, coupling is invisible when the clock is in phase with the day/night cycle but resets the clock when it is out of phase. Such a clock architecture is immune to strong daylight fluctuations.},

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We have studied the molecular basis of light-dependent control of cell division in the unicellular green alga Ostreococcus. We found that cell division obeys a circadian oscillator in Ostreococcus. We provide evidence suggesting that the clock may, at least in part, regulate directly cell division independently of the metabolism. Combined microarray and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of the main core cell cycle gene expression revealed an extensive transcriptional regulation of cell division by the photoperiod in Ostreococcus. Finally, transcription of the main core cell cycle genes, including cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases, was shown to be under circadian control in Ostreococcus, suggesting that these genes are potential targets of the circadian clock in the control of cell division.},

	abstract = {Circadian rhythms are ubiquitous in eukaryotes, and coordinate numerous aspects of behaviour, physiology and metabolism, from sleep/wake cycles in mammals to growth and photosynthesis in plants. This daily timekeeping is thought to be driven by transcriptional–translational feedback loops, whereby rhythmic expression of ‘clock’ gene products regulates the expression of associated genes in approximately 24-hour cycles. The specific transcriptional components differ between phylogenetic kingdoms. The unicellular pico-eukaryotic alga Ostreococcus tauri possesses a naturally minimized clock, which includes many features that are shared with plants, such as a central negative feedback loop that involves the morning-expressed CCA1 and evening-expressed TOC1 genes. Given that recent observations in animals and plants have revealed prominent post-translational contributions to timekeeping, a reappraisal of the transcriptional contribution to oscillator function is overdue. Here we show that non-transcriptional mechanisms are sufficient to sustain circadian timekeeping in the eukaryotic lineage, although they normally function in conjunction with transcriptional components. We identify oxidation of peroxiredoxin proteins as a transcription-independent rhythmic biomarker, which is also rhythmic in mammals. Moreover we show that pharmacological modulators of the mammalian clock mechanism have the same effects on rhythms in Ostreococcus. Post-translational mechanisms, and at least one rhythmic marker, seem to be better conserved than transcriptional clock regulators. It is plausible that the oldest oscillator components are non-transcriptional in nature, as in cyanobacteria, and are conserved across kingdoms.},

Generation times of phytoplankters range from a few hours to several days; a 24-hour lifetime can be retained as an average or an order of magnitude. Laboratory as well as field studies display a variety of diel curves for chlorophyll concentration which is one of the worst indicators of phytoplankton periodicity; nevertheless, for a given set of conditions, a definite trend is observed and cincardian correction may be worked out. The rhythm of photosynthetic capacity, or Doty and Oguri's rhythm, is identified with the physiologists's “afternoon depression”. Photosynthetic capacity is the potential photosynthesis of phytoplankton under constant light conditions; its implications on the measurement of primary production are discussed.

However, the temporal daylight pattern is not the same every day due to erratic weather fluctuations or regular seasonal changes. Then, how do circadian clocks operate properly in varying weather and seasons? In this paper, we discuss the strategy unveiled by recent studies of the circadian clock of Ostreococcus tauri, the smallest free-living eukaryotic organism. It combines mechanisms controlling light inputs and clock sensitivity, shaping both the dynamics of the core circadian oscillator and its forcing by light so as to ensure stable and precise synchronization in all weather and seasons.

	abstract = {Cultures of Rhizosolenia formosa H. Peragallo were studied to assess whether or not physiological and optical characteristics of this large diatom were consistent with the ability to migrate vertically in the open ocean. Time-course experiments examined changes in chemical composition and buoyancy of R. formosa during nitrate (N)–replete growth, N starvation, and recovery. Cells could maintain unbalanced growth for at least 53 h after depletion of ambient nitrate. Increases in C:N and carbohydrate: protein ratios observed during N starvation reversed within 24 h of reintroduction of nitrate to culture medium. Buoyancy was related to nutrition: Upon N depletion, the percentage of positively buoyant cells decreased to 4\% from 11\% but reverted to 9\% within 12 h of nitrate readdition. Cells took up nitrate in the dark. Nitrogen-specific uptake rates averaged 0.48 d−1; these rates were higher than N-specific growth rates (0. 15 d−1), indicating the potential for luxury consumption of nitrate, which can be stored for later use. Measurements of photosynthesis vs. irradiance, chlorophyll-specific absorption (aph*(λ)), and pigment composition showed that cells may be adapted for growth under a wide range of irradiances. Values of aph*(λ) were lower for N-depleted cells than for N-replete cells, and N-depleted cells had higher ratios of total carotenoids to chlorophyll a. Aggregation of chloroplasts was more pronounced in N-depleted cells. These are possibly photoprotective mechanisms that would be an advantage to N-depleted cells in surface waters. Compounds that absorb in the ultraviolet region were detected in N-replete cells but were absent in N-depleted cultures. Overall, these results have important implications for migrations of Rhizosolenia in nature. Cells may survive fairly long periods in N-depleted surface waters and will continue to take up carbon; then they can resume nitrate uptake and revert to positive buoyancy upon returning to deep, N-rich water. Uncoupled uptake of carbon and nitrogen during migrations of Rhizosolenia is a form of new production that may result in the net removal of carbon from oceanic surface waters.},

	abstract = {Background Gene clustering of periodic transcriptional profiles provides an opportunity to shed light on a variety of biological processes, but this technique relies critically upon the robust modeling of longitudinal covariance structure over time.  Methodology We propose a statistical method for functional clustering of periodic gene expression by modeling the covariance matrix of serial measurements through a general autoregressive moving-average process of order (,), the so-called ARMA(,). We derive a sophisticated EM algorithm to estimate the proportions of each gene cluster, the Fourier series parameters that define gene-specific differences in periodic expression trajectories, and the ARMA parameters that model the covariance structure within a mixture model framework. The orders  and  of the ARMA process that provide the best fit are identified by model selection criteria.  Conclusions Through simulated data we show that whenever it is necessary, employment of sophisticated covariance structures such as ARMA is crucial in order to obtain unbiased estimates of the mean structure parameters and increased precision of estimation. The methods were implemented on recently published time-course gene expression data in yeast and the procedure was shown to effectively identify interesting periodic clusters in the dataset. The new approach will provide a powerful tool for understanding biological functions on a genomic scale.},

We measured C and N active transport due to diel vertical migration (DVM) in a Svalbard fjord at 79°N. Multifrequency analysis of backscatter data from an Acoustic Zooplankton Fish Profiler moored from January to September 2014, combined with plankton net data, showed that Thysanoessa spp. euphausiids made up {\textgreater} 90\% of the diel migrant biomass. Classical synchronous DVM occurred before and after the phytoplankton bloom, leading to a mismatch with intensive primary production during the midnight sun. Zooplankton DVM resulted in C respiration of 0.9 g m−2 and ammonium excretion of 0.18 g N m−2 below 82 m depth between February and April, and 0.2 g C m−2 and 0.04 g N m−2 from 11 August to 9 September, representing {\textgreater} 25\% and {\textgreater} 33\% of sinking flux of particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, respectively. Such contribution of DVM active transport to the biological pump in this high-Arctic location is consistent with previous measurements in several equatorial to subarctic oceanic systems of the World Ocean. Climate warming is expected to result in tighter coupling between DVM and bloom periods, stronger stratification of the Barents Sea, and northward advection of boreal euphausiids. This may increase the role of DVM in the functioning of the biological pump on the Atlantic side of the Arctic Ocean, particularly where euphausiids are or will be prevalent in the zooplankton community.},

	abstract = {In mammals, the role of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) as the primary circadian clock that coordinates the biological rhythms of peripheral oscillators is well known. However, in teleosts, it remains unclear whether the SCN also functions as a circadian pacemaker. We used in situ hybridization (ISH) techniques to demonstrate that the molecular clock gene, per2, is expressed in the SCN of flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) larvae during the day and down-regulated at night, demonstrating that a circadian pacemaker exists in the SCN of this teleost. The finding that per2 expression in the SCN was also observed in the amberjack (Seriola dumerili), but not in medaka (Oryzias latipes), implies that interspecific variation exists in the extent to which the SCN controls the circadian rhythms of fish species, presumably reflecting their lifestyle. Rhythmic per2 expression was also detected in the pineal gland and pituitary, and aperiodic per2 expression was observed in the habenula, which is known to exhibit circadian rhythms in rodents. Since the ontogeny of per2 expression in the brain of early flounder larvae can be monitored by whole mount ISH, it is possible to investigate the effects of drugs and environmental conditions on the functional development of circadian clocks in the brain of fish larvae. In addition, flounder would be a good model for understanding the rhythmicity of marine fish. Our findings open a new frontier for investigating the role of the SCN in teleost circadian rhythms.},

Recent study has revealed that mRNA levels of Cryptochrome (Cry), one of the circadian clock genes, were significantly higher on a full moon night than on a new moon night in coral, implying the involvement of a photoreception system in the lunar-synchronized spawning. To better establish the generalities surrounding such a mechanism and explore the underlying molecular mechanism, we focused on the relationship between lunar phase, Cry gene expression, and the spawning behavior in a lunar-synchronized spawner, the goldlined spinefoot (Siganus guttatus), and we identified two kinds of Cry genes in this animal. Their mRNA levels showed lunar cycle-dependent expression in the medial part of the brain (mesencephalon and diencephalon) peaking at the first quarter moon. Since this lunar phase coincided with the reproductive phase of the goldlined spinefoot, Cry gene expression was considered a state variable in the lunar phase recognition system. Based on the expression profiles of SgCrys together with the moonlight's pattern of timing and duration during its nightly lunar cycle, we have further speculated on a model of lunar phase recognition for reproductive control in the goldlined spinefoot, which integrates both moonlight and circadian signals in a manner similar to photoperiodic response.},

	abstract = {Measuring day length confers a strong fitness improvement to photosynthetic organisms as it allows them to anticipate light phases and take the best decisions preceding diurnal transitions. In close association with signals from the circadian clock and the photoreceptors, photoperiodic sensing constitutes also a precise way to determine the passing of the seasons and to take annual decisions such as the best time to flower or the beginning of dormancy. Photoperiodic sensing in photosynthetic organisms is ancient and two major stages in its evolution could be identified, the cyanobacterial time sensing and the evolutionary tool kit that arose in green algae and developed into the photoperiodic system of modern plants. The most recent discoveries about the evolution of the perception of light, measurement of day length and relationship with the circadian clock along the evolution of the eukaryotic green lineage will be discussed in this review.},

In analyzing their stability the distinction is made between (1) spontaneous day-to-day instability of frequency, and (2) a longer-term lability, some of which is traceable to identified causes. 2.Serial correlation analysis indicates that the precision (day-to-day stability) of the pacemaker's period is ca. twice as good (estimated s.d.=0.6\% ofτ¯τ¯{\textbackslash}bar {\textbackslash}tau inMus musculus) as the already remarkable precision of the activity rhythm it drives (average s.d.=1.2\% ofτ¯τ¯{\textbackslash}bar {\textbackslash}tau ). 3.Identifiable causes of long-term lability include age and several features of prior entrainment by light. The period and photoperiod of a light cycle have a predictable influence on the subsequent freerunning period (τ) of the pacemaker; they cause “after-effects”. So do single light pulses causing a phase-shift in the freerunning system. Constant light also has an after-effect opposite in sign from the after-effect of long photoperiods. 4.After-effects of “skeleton” photoperiods support the hypothesis that the transitions of light to darkness vv. are involved in the entrainment process which leads to changes in τ. 5.Both day-to-day instability and long term lability are most pronounced in species (Peromyscus maniculatus, Mus musculus) whoseτ=τ={\textbackslash}mathop {\textbackslash}tau {\textbackslash}limits{\textasciicircum} = is considerably shorter than 24 h; they are least pronounced in hamsters whoseτ=τ={\textbackslash}mathop {\textbackslash}tau {\textbackslash}limits{\textasciicircum} = is indistinguishably close to 24 h. 6.The differences between the species in τ and its lability are paralleled by differences in pacemaker lability as measured in light-induced after-effects and in the extent of changes with age. The species evidently differ in the “tightness” with which τ is homeostatically conserved.},

Both forms of activity show the same free-running period (τ) in either DD (23·4 hr) or LL (25·1 hr). Although some overlap is seen between periods of locomotion and stridulation, the majority of each activity is found in different phases of the circadian cycle: locomotion occurs mainly in the subjective day and stridulation in the subjective night. Entraining LD cycles with photoperiods of 12 hr produce exogenous effects that can obscure endogenous components of the rhythms. Red light (λ{\textgreater}600 nm) causes the period to lengthen and RD cycles can entrain both rhythms. Single white light pulses of 2 or 6 hr did not produce significant phase shifts, but did cause τ to shorten when given in the subjective night. The significance of these observations is discussed. Given the results obtained to date, it is not likely that each rhythm is under the control of a separate circadian pacemaker.},

The species plays an important trophic role in subpolar and polar ecosystems as a grazer of phytoplankton and as a prey for higher trophic levels such as the larval stages of many fish species. Here, we used a recently developed ecological niche model to assess the ecological niche (sensu Hutchinson) of C. finmarchicus and characterize its spatial distribution. This model explained about 65\% of the total variance of the observed spatial distribution inferred from an independent dataset (data of the continuous plankton recorder survey). Comparisons with other types of models (structured population and ecophysiological models) revealed a clear similarity between modeled spatial distributions at the scale of the North Atlantic. Contemporary models coupled with future projections indicated a progressive reduction of the spatial habitat of the species at the southern edge and a more pronounced one in the Georges Bank, the Scotian Shelf and the North Sea and a potential increase in abundance at the northern edge of its spatial distribution, especially in the Barents Sea. These major changes will probably lead to a major alteration of the trophodynamics of North Atlantic ecosystems affecting the trophodynamics and the biological carbon pump.},

Hydrodynamical and sediment data are assessed in order to ascertain their influence on the carbon budget in the deep-sea. The currents affected by tidal, inertial and longer time-scale oscillations (20–30 and 100–120 days) were sufficiently weak (maximum ⩽14cms-1) that trap collection was probably unbiased. The average daily flux estimated at 35.2mgm-2d-1 at 2000m a.b. decreased at 28.8mgm-2d-1 at 200m a.b. Organic carbon, nitrogen and carbonate carbon fluxes decreased between these two depths, suggesting organic carbon oxidation and carbonate dissolution during descent or different sources of particles. At 10m a.b., the total particle flux (41.3mgm-2d-1) increased due to near bottom sediment resuspension. The current orientation explains more resuspension recorded in the first data set. A clear seasonal signal was not observed in this study. However, spectral analysis of the data showed a monthly variation, which might have been due to the reproductive cycle of several planktonic species or some hydrodynamical effect. The degree of correlation between fluxes at 2000 and 200m a.b. suggests that the largest particles sank at rates equal to or greater than 180md-1. At 4600m depth, 0.3\% of the surface primary production reached the deep-sea floor. Estimation of the carbon budget in the bioturbated sediment indicated that only 2\% of the organic matter carried by the downward flux was buried in the sediment.},

The implications of such figures for the origin and evolution of clocks are considerable, and the authors speculate on how this short rotational period might have influenced the development of the “protoclock” in early microorganisms, such as the Cyanobacteria, during the geological periodsin which they arose and flourished. They then discuss the subsequent duplication of clock genes that took place around and after the Cambrian period, 543 million years ago, and its consequences. They compare the relative divergences of the canonical clock genes, which reveal the Per family to be the most rapidly evolving.

Here we reviewed available information on microplastics (including macroplastics as a source of microplastics) in the Southern Ocean. We estimated primary microplastic concentrations from personal care products and laundry, and identified potential sources and routes of transmission into the region. Estimates showed the levels of microplastic pollution released into the region from ships and scientific research stations were likely to be negligible at the scale of the Southern Ocean, but may be significant on a local scale. This was demonstrated by the detection of the first microplastics in shallow benthic sediments close to a number of research stations on King George Island. Furthermore, our predictions of primary microplastic concentrations from local sources were five orders of magnitude lower than levels reported in published sampling surveys (assuming an even dispersal at the ocean surface). Sea surface transfer from lower latitudes may contribute, at an as yet unknown level, to Southern Ocean plastic concentrations. Acknowledging the lack of data describing microplastic origins, concentrations, distribution and impacts in the Southern Ocean, we highlight the urgent need for research, and call for routine, standardised monitoring in the Antarctic marine system.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have indicated a metabolic temperature sensitivity in both the arcto-boreal krill species Thysanoessa inermis and Thysanoessa raschii that may determine these species’ abundance and population persistence at lower latitudes (up to 40° N). T. inermis currently dominates the krill community in the Barents Sea and in the high Arctic Kongsfjord. We aimed to increase the knowledge on the upper thermal limit found in the latter species by estimating the CT50 value (19.7 °C) (critical temperature at which 50 \% of animals are reactive) and by linking metabolic rate measurements with molecular approaches. Optical oxygen sensors were used to measure respiration rates in steps of 2 °C (from 0 to 16 °C). To follow the temperature-mediated mechanisms of passive response, i.e., as a proxy for molecular stress, molecular chaperone heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) sequences were extracted from a transcriptome assembly, and the gene expression kinetics were monitored during an acute temperature exposure to 6 or 10 °C with subsequent recovery at 4 °C. Our results showed upregulation of hsp70 genes, especially the structurally constitutive and mitochondrial isoforms. These findings confirmed the temperature sensitivity of T. inermis and showed that the thermal stress took place before reaching the upper temperature limit estimated by respirometry at 12 °C. This study provides a baseline for further investigations into the thermal tolerances of arcto-boreal Thysanoessa spp. and comparisons with other krill species under different climatic regimes, especially Antarctica.},

	abstract = {Within the framework of the physical forcing, we describe and quantify the key ecosystem components and basic food web structure of the Barents Sea. Emphasis is given to the energy flow through the ecosystem from an end-to-end perspective, i.e. from bacteria, through phytoplankton and zooplankton to fish, mammals and birds. Primary production in the Barents is on average 93 g C m−2 y−1, but interannually highly variable (±19\%), responding to climate variability and change (e.g. variations in Atlantic Water inflow, the position of the ice edge and low-pressure pathways). The traditional focus upon large phytoplankton cells in polar regions seems less adequate in the Barents, as the cell carbon in the pelagic is most often dominated by small cells that are entangled in an efficient microbial loop that appears to be well coupled to the grazing food web. Primary production in the ice-covered waters of the Barents is clearly dominated by planktonic algae and the supply of ice biota by local production or advection is small. The pelagic–benthic coupling is strong, in particular in the marginal ice zone. In total 80\% of the harvestable production is channelled through the deep-water communities and benthos. 19\% of the harvestable production is grazed by the dominating copepods Calanus finmarchicus and C. glacialis in Atlantic or Arctic Water, respectively. These two species, in addition to capelin (Mallotus villosus) and herring (Clupea harengus), are the keystone organisms in the Barents that create the basis for the rich assemblage of higher trophic level organisms, facilitating one of the worlds largest fisheries (capelin, cod, shrimps, seals and whales). Less than 1\% of the harvestable production is channelled through the most dominating higher trophic levels such as cod, harp seals, minke whales and sea birds. Atlantic cod, seals, whales, birds and man compete for harvestable energy with similar shares. Climate variability and change, differences in recruitment, variable resource availability, harvesting restrictions and management schemes will influence the resource exploitation between these competitors, that basically depend upon the efficient energy transfer from primary production to highly successful, lipid-rich zooplankton and pelagic fishes.},

	abstract = {Research in eye evolution has mostly focused on eyes residing in the head. In contrast, noncephalic light sensors are far less understood and rather regarded as evolutionary innovations. We established stable transgenesis in the annelid Platynereis, a reference species for evolutionary and developmental comparisons. EGFP controlled by cis-regulatory elements of r-opsin, a characteristic marker for rhabdomeric photoreceptors, faithfully recapitulates known r-opsin expression in the adult eyes, and marks a pair of pigment-associated frontolateral eyelets in the brain. Unexpectedly, transgenic animals revealed an additional series of photoreceptors in the ventral nerve cord as well as photoreceptors that are located in each pair of the segmental dorsal appendages (notopodia) and project into the ventral nerve cord. Consistent with a photosensory function of these noncephalic cells, decapitated animals display a clear photoavoidance response. Molecular analysis of the receptors suggests that they differentiate independent of pax6, a gene involved in early eye development of many metazoans, and that the ventral cells may share origins with the Hesse organs in the amphioxus neural tube. Finally, expression analysis of opn4×-2 and opn4m-2, two zebrafish orthologs of Platynereis r-opsin, reveals that these genes share expression in the neuromasts, known mechanoreceptors of the lateral line peripheral nervous system. Together, this establishes that noncephalic photoreceptors are more widespread than assumed, and may even reflect more ancient aspects of sensory systems. Our study marks significant advance for the understanding of photoreceptor cell (PRC) evolution and development and for Platynereis as a functional lophotrochozoan model system.},

While many studies have focused on elucidating peptidergic systems in higher crustaceans, little is known about neuropeptides in the more primitive crustacean taxa. Here, we have begun an investigation of the peptides present in the central nervous system (CNS) of the copepod crustacean Calanus finmarchicus, presenting immunohistochemical data on the presence and distribution of pigment dispersing hormone (PDH) and tachykinin-related peptide (TRP). In this species, strong PDH-like immunoreactivity was restricted to one pair of somata in the protocerebrum (PC) and the axonal projections emanating from them. TRP-like immunopositive structures were present in the PC, deutocerebrum (DC), tritocerebrum (TC), and ventral nerve cord (VNC). In the PC, a single soma in the left hemisphere was labeled. This neuron appears to be the source of a centrally located, bilaterally symmetric plexus present within the PC. In the DC, two pairs of intensely immunopositive somata were labeled, each projecting axons toward the posterior and producing an extensive collection of putative release terminals that spans the DC, TC, and anterior portion of the VNC. Several other more weakly labeled somata were also present in the DC. Double-labeling studies indicated that no co-localization of PDH- and TRP-like peptides is present in the C. finmarchicus CNS. As preadsorption controls completely abolished each label, we feel these data represent accurate distributions of PDH- and TRP-like peptides within the C. finmarchicus CNS, thus providing a framework for future studies of the functional roles members of these peptide families play in this copepod species.},

	abstract = {Organisms have evolved to cope with geophysical cycles of different period lengths. In this review, we focus on the adaptations of animals to the lunar cycle, specifically, on the occurrence of biological rhythms with monthly (circalunar) or semi-monthly (circasemilunar) period lengths. Systematic experimental investigation, starting in the early 20th century, has allowed scientists to distinguish between mythological belief and scientific facts concerning the influence of the lunar cycle on animals. These studies revealed that marine animals of various taxa exhibit circalunar or circasemilunar reproductive rhythms. Some of these rely on endogenous oscillators (circalunar or circasemilunar clocks), whereas others are directly driven by external cues, such as the changes in nocturnal illuminance. We review current insight in the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in circalunar rhythms, focusing on recent work in corals, annelid worms, midges and fishes. In several of these model systems, the transcript levels of some core circadian clock genes are affected by both light and endogenous circalunar oscillations. How these and other molecular changes relate to the changes in physiology or behavior over the lunar cycle remains to be determined. We further review the possible relevance of circalunar rhythms for terrestrial species, with a particular focus on mammalian reproduction. Studies on circalunar rhythms of conception or birth rates extend to humans, where the lunar cycle was suggested to also affect sleep and mental health. While these reports remain controversial, factors like the increase in ‘light pollution’ by artificial light might contribute to discrepancies between studies. We finally discuss the existence of circalunar oscillations in mammalian physiology. We speculate that these oscillations could be the remnant of ancient circalunar oscillators that were secondarily uncoupled from a natural entrainment mechanism, but still maintained relevance for structuring the timing of reproduction or physiology. The analysis and comparison of circalunar rhythms and clocks is currently challenging due to the heterogeneity of samples concerning species diversity, environmental and chronobiological conditions. We suggest that future research will benefit from the development of standardized experimental paradigms, and common principles for recording and reporting environmental conditions, especially light spectra and intensities.},

The fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster senses day–night cycles in part through rhodopsin-dependent light reception in the compound eye and photoreceptor cells in the Hofbauer–Buchner eyelet. A more noteworthy light entrainment pathway is mediated by central pacemaker neurons in the brain. The Drosophila circadian clock is extremely sensitive to light. However, the only known light sensor in pacemaker neurons, the flavoprotein cryptochrome (Cry), responds only to high levels of light in vitro. These observations indicate that there is an additional light-sensing pathway in fly pacemaker neurons. Here we describe a previously uncharacterized rhodopsin, Rh7, which contributes to circadian light entrainment by circadian pacemaker neurons in the brain. The pacemaker neurons respond to violet light, and this response depends on Rh7. Loss of either cry or rh7 caused minor defects in photoentrainment, whereas loss of both caused profound impairment. The circadian photoresponse to constant light was impaired in rh7 mutant flies, especially under dim light. The demonstration that Rh7 functions in circadian pacemaker neurons represents, to our knowledge, the first role for an opsin in the central brain.},

	abstract = {The copepod crustacean Calanus finmarchicus plays a critical role in the ecology of the Gulf of Maine and other regions of the North Atlantic. To increase our understanding of the physiology of this species, a normalized, whole organism cDNA library was constructed, and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of the clones were generated. Among these ESTs was one with homology to known cDNAs encoding prepro-A-type allatostatins (A-type ASTs), a well-known family of arthropod peptides that regulate juvenile hormone production in insects. Sequence analysis of the clone from which the EST was generated, with subsequent translation of its open reading frame, showed it to encode five novel A-type ASTs, whose mature structures were predicted to be APYGFGIamide, pE/EPYGFGIamide, ALYGFGIamide, pE/EPYNFGIamide, and pQ/QPYNFGVamide. Each of the peptides is present as a single copy within the prepro-hormone with the exception of APYGFGIamide, which is present in three copies. Surprisingly, the organization of the Calanus prepro-A-type AST, specifically the number of encoded A-type peptides, is more similar to those of insects than it is to the known decapod crustacean prepro-hormones. Moreover, the Calanus A-type ASTs possess isoleucine or valine residues at their carboxy (C)-termini rather than leucine, which is present in most other family members. Wholemount immunohistochemistry suggests that six pairs of somata produce the native Calanus A-type ASTs: five in the protocerebrum and one in the suboesophageal region. To the best of our knowledge, our report is the first characterization of a neuropeptidergic system in a copepod, the first identification of A-type ASTs from a non-decapod crustacean, the first report of crustacean A-type ASTs possessing isoleucine C-terminal residues, and the first report from any species of an A-type peptide possessing a valine C-terminal residue.},

	abstract = {On one night per year, at a specific point in the lunar cycle, one of the most extraordinary reproductive events on the planet unfolds as hundreds of millions of broadcast spawning corals release their trillions of gametes into the waters of the tropical seas. Each species spawns on a specific night within the lunar cycle, typically from full moon to third quarter moon, and in a specific time window after sunset. This accuracy is essential to achieve efficient fertilization in the vastness of the oceans. In this report, we use transcriptome sequencing at noon and midnight across an entire lunar cycle to explore how acroporid corals interpret lunar signals. The data were interrogated by both time-of-day-dependent and time-of-day-independent methods to identify different types of lunar cycles. Time-of-day methods found that genes associated with biological clocks and circadian processes change their diurnal cycles over the course of a synodic lunar cycle. Some genes have large differences between day and night at some lunar phases, but little or no diurnal differences at other phases. Many clock genes display an oscillation pattern indicative of phase shifts linked to the lunar cycle. Time-independent methods found that signal transduction, protein secretion and modification, cell cycle and ion transport change over the lunar timescale and peak at various phases of the moon. Together these data provide unique insights into how the moon impinges on coral transcription cycles and how lunar light may regulate circalunar timing systems and coral biology.},

	abstract = {Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is a highly abundant and ecologically important zooplankton species in the Southern Ocean. Regions of elevated Antarctic krill biomass exist around Antarctica, often as a result of the concentrating effect of bathymetry and ocean currents. Such areas are considered biological hotspots and are key foraging grounds for numerous top predators in the region. A hotspot of Antarctic krill biomass exists off the southern extent of Anvers Island, Western Antarctic Peninsula, and supports a population of Adélie penguins that feed almost exclusively on it, as well as numerous other top predators. We investigated the spatio-temporal variability in Antarctic krill biomass and aggregation structure over four consecutive summer seasons, identifying environmental factors that were responsible. We identified three distinct krill aggregation types (Large-dense, Small-close and Small-sparse), and found that the relative proportion of each type to total aggregation numbers varied significantly between survey days. Large-dense aggregations occurred more frequently when westerly winds predominated and when the local mixed tide was in the diurnal regime. Small-close aggregations were also more frequent during diurnal tides and were negatively correlated with phytoplankton biomass. Small-sparse aggregations, on the other hand, were more prevalent when the mixed tide was in the semi-diurnal phase.

	abstract = {Adaptation to seasonal changes in the northern hemisphere includes an ability to predict the forthcoming cold season from gradual changes in environmental cues early enough to prepare for the harsh winter conditions. The magnitude and speed of changes in these cues vary between the latitudes, which induces strong selection pressures for local adaptation. We studied adaptation to seasonal changes in Drosophila montana, a northern maltfly, by defining the photoperiodic conditions leading to adult reproductive diapause along a latitudinal cline in Finland and by measuring genetic differentiation and the amount of gene flow between the sampling sites with microsatellites. Our data revealed a clear correlation between the latitude and the critical day length (CDL), in which half of the females of different cline populations enter photoperiodic reproductive diapause. There was no sign of limited gene flow between the cline populations, even though these populations showed isolation by distance. Our results show that local adaptation may occur even in the presence of high gene flow, when selection for locally adaptive life-history traits is strong. A wide range of variation in the CDLs of the fly strains within and between the cline populations may be partly due to gene flow and partly due to the opposing selection pressures for fly reproduction and overwinter survival. This variation in the timing of diapause will enhance populations’ survival over the years that differ in the severity of the winter and in the length of the warm period and may also help them respond to long-term changes in environmental conditions.},

Two fjords in West Spitsbergen (Hornsund 77°N and Kongsfjorden 79°N) differ with regard to their exposure towards increasingly warm Atlantic water inflow. Hornsund remains in many respects cooler than Kongsfjorden (on average 2°C SST in summer) and is less influenced by warmer and more saline Atlantic waters. Reported changes in the physical environment (temperature rise, freshwater inflow, salinity drop, turbidity, fast-ice reduction, coastal change) are discussed in the context of biological observations in the pelagic and benthic realms with special reference to krill (Euphausiacea). We conclude that well-documented changes in the physical environment have had little effect on the fjord biota and that both organisms and their ecological functions in the fjords are well adapted to the scale of ongoing change. The observed changes fit the definition of ecosystem maturation, with greater diversity, a more complex food web and dispersed energy flow at the warmer site.},

Juvenile prawns of M. tenellum (0.61 ± 0.21 g) were collected from a natural affluent in the area of Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, Mexico. For basal digestive enzymatic activity, five prawns were randomly sampled from of a stack of 200 organisms in fasting conditions every hour over a period of 24 h under natural photoperiod (13:11 h; light: dark); for digestive enzymatic activity under different photoperiod conditions, five organisms were randomly sampled every two hours during a 24 h period after eight days of pre-acclimatization under three photoperiod treatments (0:24 h, 13:11 h, and 24:0 h); and for the effect of molt cycle on the digestive enzymatic activity, 15 prawns from each molting stage (premolt, D; intermolt, C; postmolt, B) were sampled during one-hour span (08:00–09:00 h). All sampled prawns were sacrificed by immersion in ice cold water and stored at − 20 °C until use for subsequent biochemical analysis. Enzymatic extract of the complete organisms was obtained to determine specific activity of general protease, trypsin, chymotrypsin, amylase, and lipase. To conclude, the circadian cycle of digestive enzymatic activity in M. tenellum for the general proteases, lipases, and amylases was biphasic at 08:00 and 20:00 h with a fluctuation of less activity throughout the day, which could be affected by the alteration of the natural photoperiod, modifying enzyme concentrations and basal peaks; likewise, the concentration of digestive enzymes was different in each of the molt cycle phases, showing the highest concentration of general proteases, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and lipases during postmolt (B). This is the first study on digestive enzymatic activity of M. tenellum juveniles, creating the basis to clarify its digestive physiology and contributing to nutritional knowledge of the species.},

In crayfish, MEL content in eyestalks (Ey) increases at night under the photoperiod, and this indoleamine synchronizes the circadian rhythm of electroretinogram amplitude, which is expressed by retinas and controlled by the cerebroid ganglion (CG). The aim of this study was to determine whether MEL content in eyestalks and CG or circulating MEL in hemolymph (He) follows a circadian rhythm under a free-running condition; in addition, it was tested whether MEL might directly influence the spontaneous electrical activity of the CG. Crayfish were maintained under constant darkness and temperature, a condition suitable for studying the intrinsic properties of circadian systems. MEL was quantified in samples obtained from He, Ey, and CG by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the effect of exogenous MEL on CG spontaneous activity was evaluated by electrophysiological recording. Variation of MEL content in He, Ey, and CG followed a circadian rhythm that peaked at the same circadian time (CT). In addition, a single dose of MEL injected into the crayfish at different CTs reduced the level of spontaneous electrical activity in the CG. Results suggest that the circadian increase in MEL content directly affects the CG, reducing its spontaneous electrical activity, and that MEL might act as a periodical signal to reinforce the organization of the circadian system in crayfish.},

These cells show distinct architecture and transduce the light signal by different phototransductory cascades. In the marine rag-worm Platynereis, we find both cell types: rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells in the eyes and ciliary photoreceptor cells in the brain. The latter use a photopigment closely related to vertebrate rod and cone opsins. Comparative analysis indicates that both types of photoreceptors, with distinct opsins, coexisted in Urbilateria, the last common ancestor of insects and vertebrates, and sheds new light on vertebrate eye evolution.
The presence of an analog of a vertebrate eye in a primitive worm suggests that prototypes of both insect and vertebrate eyes existed in their last common ancestor.

	abstract = {The interest in large-scale culturing of copepods for marine fish aquaculture is growing, however studies quantifying the optimal conditions for intensive copepod production are generally lacking for most species. In the present study, we examined how large ranges in each of three factors (salinity, photoperiod duration, and culture density) influenced the egg production (EP) and 48-h egg hatching success (HS) of Acartia tonsa Dana (Copepoda : Calanoida). The effect of anaerobic storage time (2 to 185 d) at 4 °C on HS of eggs was also quantified. In this species, HS was more strongly impacted by differences in salinity and photoperiod than was EP while the opposite was true for the impact of adult stocking density. In terms of salinity, the lowest and highest mean EP (17 and 40 eggs female−1 d−1) was observed at 30 and 14 psu, respectively, and HS was estimated to be {\textgreater}75\% for all salinities {\textgreater}13 psu. The photoperiod duration (used to rear copepods and incubate eggs) had little effect on total daily EP but significantly influenced HS which was 27, 55, 85 and 78\% at photoperiods of 8, 12, 16, and 20 h, respectively. Adult stocking density had no effect on HS but the relative number of eggs harvested (\# female−1) was highest at 65 ind l−l and lowest at 425 ind l−1. For eggs produced using a 12 h photoperiod, HS (\%) decreased linearly by 4\% every 20 days (i.e., the HS of eggs incubated at 20 psu was predicted to be ∼82\% and 47\% after one week and six months of storage, respectively). For maximum egg production and 48-h egg hatching success of A. tonsa cultures, results of this study suggest using salinities of 14 to 20 psu, photoperiods between 16 and 20 h, and low (∼50 ind l−1) adult stocking densities.},

	abstract = {It is now recognized that Calanus finmarchicus, the dominant copepod zooplankter of the North Atlantic, has most of its biomass in the open ocean. While the Labrador Sea does contain a large population of Calanus finmarchicus, the importance of possible connections with the rest of the North Atlantic are not understood. Although there are few wintertime observations, sufficient data exist to model the role of the circulation, temperature and food supply on population dynamics. This study couples a biological model of Calanus finmarchicus with a physical oceanographic model of the Labrador Sea, using chlorophyll data derived from observations by the satellite-borne SeaWiFS (Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor) as a proxy food supply for the numerical copepods. We produce a large-scale, comprehensive picture of the spatial distribution of Calanus finmarchicus in the Labrador Sea, along with an exploration of the timing of diapause and an examination of population sustainability. We are able to simulate reasonably well the temporal and spatial patterns of Calanus finmarchicus in the Labrador Sea. During a year long model run, the population has a single generation over most of the Labrador Sea, with a final diapausing population about 50\% the size of the initial for the parameters used in these simulations. A latitudinally dependent diapause emergence scheme with early emergence to the south of Newfoundland provides the best fit to data. A change of 0.5°C in the temperature field can cause significant changes in the population abundance in a single year, due to changes in Calanus finmarchicus growth rates.},

A control group, for each sex, was maintained under 7L/17D. The birds of all groups behaved as if they had been exposed to stimulatory photoperiod except those of G1, G8 and control. Further, serum levels of testosterone in males and estradiol-17β in females ran almost parallel to changes in gonadal size. Birds, when exposed to 12L/12D, showed entrainment of their locomotor activity rhythm with the activity confined mainly during the light phase. However, various characteristics of the activity rhythm differed significantly upon transfer of birds to various night interruption regimes. These results suggest the involvement of endogenous circadian rhythm in photoperiodic time measurement during induction of gonadal growth and function in the tree sparrow. Also, there is photic entrainment of locomotor activity rhythm that shows variations in various circadian characteristics under different night interruption cycles suggesting that the photoinducible phase is deferentially sensitive to light.},

	abstract = {A copepod in a seasonal environment continuously faces the trade-offs among allocating surplus growth to a storage compartment (lipids), to somatic growth or to reproduction. By building up lipids, it can survive periods with low food, and gain reproductive success the following season by transforming fat to eggs. Also, copepods face a trade-off between survival and growth, as surface waters generally are more risky and productive than the dark refuges at greater depths, both in the diel and annual temporal scale. Implicit in these trade-offs are the numbers of generations, population dynamics and productive potential of the copepod. The authors develop a model which is used to investigate (1) how optimal diel arid ontogenetic vertical migration might vary with season, individual state (size and lipid reserves) and growth conditions; (2) whether fat is mainly used for overwintering or for fueling reproduction in early spring; and (3) the adaptive value of behavioural flexibility in migration patterns. The model suggests an explanation for observations of absence of vertical migration during spring bloom and before descent to overwintering, and it suggests 1–2 successful generations per year in its basic version. It shows that migratory strategies are not similar between stages and strongly depend on the level of accumulated reserves, that the risk of predation can affect growth, distribution and number of generations and that one should expect phenotypic plasticity in DVM patterns. The model is very sensitive to the rate of metabolism during dormancy.},

The goal is to provide an overview of the most common issues that arise in the analysis and interpretation of data in these fields. In this article on time series analysis for biological rhythms, we describe some methods for assessing the rhythmic properties of time series, including tests of whether a time series is indeed rhythmic. Because biological rhythms can exhibit significant fluctuations in their period, phase, and amplitude, their analysis may require methods appropriate for nonstationary time series, such as wavelet transforms, which can measure how these rhythmic parameters change over time. We illustrate these methods using simulated and real time series.},

Newly eclosed female flies (Canton-S wild type) exposed to short days (less than 14 hr of light per day) at 12 degrees C (or 10 degrees C) enter a fairly shallow reproductive diapause. Females exposed to long days (16 hr of light per day) at the same low temperature undergo ovarian maturation. The short day induced diapause continues for 6-7 weeks under a 10:14 light/dark cycle at 12 degrees C but is terminated rapidly after a transfer to higher temperature (18 or 25 degrees C) or to long days (18:6 light/dark cycle). Females from three strains homozygous for alleles of the period (per) locus, reportedly arrhythmic for behavioral circadian rhythms, and females that possessed two overlapping deletions of per were also capable of discriminating between long and short days, although, when compared with the wild-type flies, the critical day length was shifted to shorter values by approximately 2 hr. It is concluded that the period locus is not causally involved in photoperiod time measurement.},

Here, alternative views of the role of copepods as an intermediary link in North Atlantic marine food chains are discussed. Following Bainbridge \& McKay (1968) and Cushing (1982), a strong link between phytoplankton and fisheries variability is proposed for some fish stocks, like cod and redfish, that spawn in spring in regions where Calanus finmarchicus dominates the plankton. Otherwise, in regions where small copepods and other micro- zooplankton dominate the prey field productivity for larval fish, a weak link is proposed. Experimental studies, including laboratory observations of copepod reproductive response to food concentration and incubation techniques for measuring in situ reproductive rates, are important for understanding how copepod dynamics may filter year-to-year differences in phytoplankton production cycles.},

	abstract = {The Faroe–Shetland Channel is an important overwintering area for the copepod Calanus finmarchicus in the north-east Atlantic. Stage V copepodites descend to depths of greater than 600 m, where they remain in an arrested development state (diapause) until the following spring. The ascent of the copepods back to the surface waters in the spring was investigated by six surveys in the Faroe–Shetland Channel between October 1993 and May 1995. In February, the first animals emerged from diapause and moulted to become stage VI males; these ascended to depths of 300–500 m. Females constituted a higher proportion of animals that emerged later in the season and these ascended through the layer of males, presumably mating on the way, and proceeded to the upper 100 m to begin spawning in March. Emergence was not synchronous in the population, and was estimated to occur over a 60–70 day period beginning around 10 February. The mean ascent rate of individuals was estimated to be 15–20 m day–1, so that for any individual the ascent from a mean overwintering depth of 800 m to a depth of 100 m took between 35 and 47 days. The ascent migration resulted in the mass transfer of the C. finmarchicus stock from its overwintering habitat in the cold southerly flowing Norwegian Sea Deep Water of Arctic origin to warm northerly flowing Atlantic water masses. The extent of asynchrony suggests that emergence is probably not triggered by environmental cues. An alternative hypothesis for regulation of the life cycle is proposed that involves reduced development rates during the winter.},

	abstract = {Ciliary opsins were classically thought to function only in vertebrates for vision, but they have been recently identified also in invertebrates for non-visual photoreception. Larvae of the annelid Platynereis dumerilii are used as a zooplankton model, and this zooplankton species possesses a "vertebrate-type" ciliary opsin (named c-opsin) in the brain. Platynereis c-opsin is suggested to relay light signals to melatonin production and circadian behaviors. Thus, the spectral and biochemical characteristics of this c-opsin would be directly related to non-visual photoreception in this zooplankton model. Here, we demonstrate that the c-opsin can sense UV to activate intracellular signaling cascades, and that it can directly bind exogenous all-trans-retinal. These results suggest that this c-opsin regulates circadian signaling in a UV-dependent manner and that it does not require supply of 11-cis-retinal for photoreception. Avoidance of damaging UV irradiation is a major cause of a large-scale daily zooplankton movement, and the observed capability of the c-opsin to transmit UV signals and bind all-trans-retinal is ideally suited for sensing UV radiation in the brain, which presumably lacks enzymes producing 11-cis-retinal. Mutagenesis analyses indicated that a unique amino acid residue (Lys-94) is responsible for c-opsin-mediated UV sensing in the Platynereis brain. We therefore propose that acquisition of the lysine residue in the c-opsin would be a critical event in the evolution of Platynereis to enable detection of ambient UV. In summary, our findings indicate that the c-opsin possesses spectral and biochemical properties suitable for UV sensing by the zooplankton model.},

	abstract = {The daily and seasonal cycles of spectral and intensity content in the sunlight that reaches the earth's surface constitutes a natural pacemaker for activity in the terrestrial biosphere. In humans and most mammals, the evolutionary consequence of this rhythmicity is the existence of a circadian rhythm, which regulates various vital activities such as the production of hormones, mating and feeding times, and sleep according to the solar angle and the characteristics of the daylight. Thus there is a spectral-temporal relationship underpinning the rhythmicity that got built into us over the 1,000,000 years of evolution but now has to learn to cope with the abrupt changes brought in by electric lighting 100 years ago, To improve human quality of life and wellness, it is desired to incorporate the principal characteristics of daylight' rhythmicity in lighting. Here we describe a smart LED lighting system capable of reproducing daylight's changes in relative spectral power and circadian content with time-of- day. It achieves high-fidelity reproduction of daylight's spectral and circadian content as a function of time in a compact, relatively inexpensive and novel system that could readily be adapted for production and may offer an additional yet unstudied solutions in areas were lighting as therapy are being developed.},

	abstract = {Wrasse species exhibit a definite daily rhythm in locomotor activity and bury themselves in the sand at the bottom of the ocean at night. It remains unclear how their behavior in locomotor activity is endogenously regulated. The aim of the present study was to clarify the involvement of melatonin and clock genes (Per1, Per2, Bmal1, and Cry1) in daily and circadian rhythms of the threespot wrasse, Halichoeres trimaculatus, which is a common species in coral reefs. Daily and circadian rhythms in locomotor activity were monitored under conditions of light–dark cycle (LD = 12:12), constant light (LL), and darkness (DD). Daily rhythms in locomotor activity were observed under LD and persisted under LL and DD. Melatonin from a cultured pineal gland showed daily variations with an increase during the nighttime and a decrease during daytime, which persisted under DD. Melatonin treatment induced decreases in locomotor activity and respiratory rate, suggesting that melatonin has a sleep-inducing effect. Per1 and Per2 mRNA abundance in the brain under LD showed daily rhythms with an increase around lights on. Robust oscillation of Per1 and Per2 mRNA expression persisted under DD and LL, respectively. Expression of Bmal1 and Cry1 mRNA also showed daily and circadian patterns. These results suggest that clock genes are related to circadian rhythms in locomotor activity and that melatonin plays a role in inducing a sleep-like state after fish bury themselves in the sand. We conclude that the sleep–wake rhythm of the wrasse is regulated by a coordination of melatonin and clock genes.},

The mechanisms by which clock neurons in the Drosophila brain confer an ∼24-hr rhythm onto locomotor activity are unclear, but involve the neuropeptide diuretic hormone 44 (DH44), an ortholog of corticotropin-releasing factor. Here we identified DH44 receptor 1 as the relevant receptor for rest:activity rhythms and mapped its site of action to hugin-expressing neurons in the subesophageal zone (SEZ). We traced a circuit that extends from Dh44-expressing neurons in the pars intercerebralis (PI) through hugin+ SEZ neurons to the ventral nerve cord. Hugin neuropeptide, a neuromedin U ortholog, also regulates behavioral rhythms. The DH44 PI-Hugin SEZ circuit controls circadian locomotor activity in a daily cycle but has minimal effect on feeding rhythms, suggesting that the circadian drive to feed can be separated from circadian locomotion.

	abstract = {The seasonal ontogenetic migration of the Arctic copepod Calanus hyperboreus was described from surface-to-bottom hauls in the central Greenland Sea Gyre (GSG) and in the Westspitsbergen Current (WSC). All stages except females spent the winter below 500 m in the GSG and below 1000 m in the WSC. Seasonal ascent begins in April, and descent in July. For the C.␣hyperboreus population an active downward transport of 8.1 g m−2 dry weight during 8 months of overwintering was estimated, similar to flux rates of particulate matter in sediment traps. Seasonal distribution of biomass was determined from weight measurements of single stages. Annual means varied from 4.0 to 9.2 g m−2 in two different years in the GSG and were 1.1 in 1 year in the WSC. The life cycle in the Greenland Sea was reconstructed from field data on stage composition, vertical distribution, reproduction, and moult cycle phase from tooth development of CV. Laboratory experiments were conducted on the moulting of CIV and CV in fall. A 3-year (males) and 3- to 4-year (females) life cycle is proposed for the GSG and 2 to 3 years for the WSC. However, the small number of young larvae and the incomplete spring ascent by older copepodites observed in the WSC cast doubt on the reproductive success in the WSC. A suite of physiological strategies and adaptations performed by the developmental stages support survival of this species in harsh environments.},

The lipid accumulation mechanism for the initiation of over-summering is unknown. Here, we cultured C3 copepodites at four constant temperatures (10, 13, 16, and 19°C) and at three temperature regimes that mimicked the temperature variations experienced during diurnal vertical migration (10–13°C, 10–16°C, and 10–19°C) for 18 days to explore the effects of temperature differences on copepod development and lipid accumulation. C. sinicus stored more lipid at low than at high temperatures. A diurnal temperature difference (10–16°C and 10–19°C) promoted greater lipid accumulation (1.9–2.1 times) than a constant temperature of either 16°C or 19°C, by reducing the energy cost at colder temperatures and lengthening copepodite development. Thereafter, the lipid reserve supported gonad development after final molting. Only one male developed in these experiments. This highly female-skewed sex ratio may have been the result of the monotonous microalgae diet fed to the copepodites. This study provides the first evidence that diurnal temperature differences may promote lipid accumulation in C. sinicus, and provides a foundation for future investigations into the mechanisms involved in over-summering in the YSCWM.},

	abstract = {Seasonal variations in the gonad development and sex ratio of copepodite stage V (CV) and adults were examined from February to November in order to understand the reproductive cycle and the life history of Calanus glacialis in the White Sea. Gonad maturation, sexual differentiation and moulting to adults take place during the 2nd year of development. Energy accumulation takes place in the spring and summer of the 2nd year. The following autumn/winter is the major period of CV maturation, which occurs independent of food supply. Maturation of males precedes that of females by 2–3 months. The maximum proportions of CV and adult males are found in the population in October and November. The onset of female maturation is observed in February and March, ca. 2 months prior to the spring phytoplankton bloom. Reproduction takes place between April and June. Its termination in the second half of June coincides with the warming of the surface water layer where egg laying takes place. Variations in the gonad morphology throughout the year suggest long life spans and iteroparity of females of C. glacialis in the White Sea. Many of them survive for several months after reproduction and are able to overwinter again. Therefore, females with different life histories co-occur in the population in winter: “young” females recently moulted from the overwintering CVs, and “old” females which have spawned at least once in their life, after which they return to overwintering conditions. In contrast, males have shorter life spans of 3–4 months resulting in a sex ratio skewed toward females at all seasons.},

Atlantic Ocean and seven sites in the Norwegian Sea. Among 104 individuals for which sequence data were obtained there were 30 mitochondrial haplotypes. One haplotype occurred in 59 individuals and was found in all but two of the samples, while 21 haplotypes were unique. Both nucleotide diversity (π = 0.0061) and haplotype diversity (h= 0.67) were moderate. There were significant differences in the frequencies of the haplotypes among the samples (P {\textless} 0.001 by chi-square test by Monte Carlo simulation). One sample collected from the Norwegian Sea and one sample from the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence were distinct from all other samples, perhaps as a result of advection from different oceartographic regions. Chi-square tests resolved four groups: one consisting of the three Georges Bank, two Gulf of Maine, and two (of three) Gulf of St. Lawrence samples, another consisting of most of the Norwegian Sea samples, and two others consisting of the distinct samples listed above. These groups differed significantly in haplotype frequencies (P {\textless} 0.001). A population genetic statistic used to describe population genetic structure, FST = 0.188, indicated some differentiation of these groups. The pooled samples on either side of the ocean (all western N. Atlantic vs. all Norwegian Sea samples) differed in haplotype frequency (P {\textless} 0.033). Based on sequence variation for this mitochondrial gene, C. finmarchicus is genetically structured on meso– and large scales; gene flow across the species range is high. Future studies will examine the relationship between population genetic structure and physical structure at meso- to large scales in the ocean, as defined by ocean circulation patterns},

A Michigan and a Florida population were exposed to dormancy inducing conditions (low temperature and short photoperiod) in the laboratory and observed for indications of dormancy. All Michigan individuals and a small percentage of the Florida individuals entered dormancy as indicated by prolonged duration of the fourth copepodid instar and cessation of feeding. I suggest that in these population these observations represent diapause, rather than quiescence. The two populations were crossbred to examine the nature of inheritance of dormancy. The F1 hybrids exhibited an incidence of diapause approximately intermediate between the Florida and Michigan parental stocks. The backcrosses of F1 individuals to the Michigan and Florida stocks, respectively, exhibited a high and an intermediate incidence of diapause. Survival of the F2 crosses was very low. The present study presents evidence of genetic differentiation between the Michigan and Florida populations of M. edax with respect to ability to diapause.},

Natural selection acting on the timing of diapause fluctuates between years depending upon the population density of fish. Here we show that, in the field, the mean timing of diapause shifts between years in response to fluctuations in selection. Diapause is earlier in years following high predator density, and is later in years following low predator density. Although selection intensity in individual years may be large, the mean intensity over the decade of fluctuating selection investigated here is close to zero. Photoperiod sensitivity of the diapausetiming trait is heritable in the laboratory. The combination of fluctuating selection and multi-generation storage of genotypes as diapausing eggs in lake sediments may contribute to the maintenance of the genetic variation that permits the rapid selection response seen in the field.},

We show here that nearly continuous daylight at high latitudes causes a relaxation in diel migratory behaviour in zooplankton irrespective of predation risk. At lower latitudes, however, similar conditions lead to pronounced diel rhythms in migration. Hence, zooplankton may show local behavioural adaptations in their circadian rhythm. They are also able to make risk assessments as to whether diel migration is beneficial or not, manifested in a lack of diel migration at near constant daylight, irrespective of predator presence. Our results provide an additional explanation to previous knowledge regarding diel migrations among aquatic invertebrates by showing that both physical (light) and biological (predation) factors may affect the migratory behaviour.},

	abstract = {The cryptochrome − photolyase family (CPF) consists of homologous flavoproteins having completely different functions involving DNA repair, circadian rhythm and/or photoreception. From the original photolyases, working either as (6-4) or cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyases, the animal- and plant-type cryptochromes, respectively, evolved and also the more intermediate DASH cryptochromes. Whereas animal cryptochromes work mostly in clock-related functions, plant cryptochromes are also directly involved in developmental processes such as hypocotyl elongation or flower induction. In diatoms, all types of cryptochromes and photolyases were predicted from genome sequences. However, up to now only two proteins have been characterised in more detail, CPF1 and CryP. CPF1 is related to animal-type cryptochromes, but works as a (6-4) photolyase in addition to having photoreceptor functions. It was shown to interact with the CLOCK:Bmal1 heterodimer in a heterologous system, and thus is probably involved in clock-related processes. Moreover, CPF1 directly influences transcription. The latter was also true for CryP, which is a cryptochrome distantly related to plant-type cryptochromes. In addition, CryP influences light-harvesting protein accumulation. For all diatom cryptochromes, down-stream signalling has to proceed via interaction partners different from the classical proteins involved in cryptochrome signalling in higher plants, because these candidates are missing in diatoms.},

	abstract = {The important calanoid copepod species Calanus finmarchicus and C. helgolandicus have distinct geographic ranges which are changing under the influence of climate change. Understanding the mechanisms underlying their distributions is becoming increasingly important as a result of the possible ecological impacts of these range shifts. Here we review inter-species differences in key life cycle traits that influence each species’ geographic distribution, in particular development and growth, fecundity, feeding behaviour, vertical migration and overwintering behaviour. The distinct temperature niche of each species leads to an a priori assumption that the response of life cycle traits to temperature is a key determinant of their contrasting geographic distributions. A new development model was created to reconcile published experimental development times for each species. Model output indicates that at temperatures below approximately 12–13°C, C. finmarchicus is the faster developing species, but above these temperatures C. helgolandicus develops more quickly. Conventionally Calanus development time is assumed to decrease monotonically with temperature; however our model indicates that the response of development time to temperature is instead U-shaped. Differences in life cycle aspects such as seasonality and vertical structuring are interpreted in light of this development model. Body size and lipid accumulation abilities could be significant influences on each species’ geographic distribution; however evidence is consistent with inter-species differences not existing for these traits. Published evidence shows that inter-species differences in egg production may exist, but do not follow a clear pattern. Diapause is an important and well studied life cycle adaptation of C. finmarchicus, but has received little attention in C. helgolandicus. We reviewed knowledge of diapause and suggest the hypothesis that C. helgolandicus is restricted to continental shelf regions as a result of an inability to diapause for significant periods. This synthesised view of each species’ respective life cycle traits is that response of growth and development to temperature is the only known difference between each species, which indicates a promising direction for the extension of population models of C. finmarchicus to C. helgolandicus.},

	abstract = {Developmental time and stage duration for Calanus pacificus Brodsky and Pseudocalanus sp. and the rate of loss of body carbon by molting for C. pacificus were estimated for copepodite stages cultured under various combinations of phytoplankton concentration and temperature. Mean development time and stage duration for C. pacificus decreased hyperbolically with increasing food concentration, and the minimum time required for reaching a given stage decreased logarithmically with a logarithmic increase in temperature. Low temperature retarded the development of early stages proportionally more than that of late stages, and stage duration increased logarithmically with increasing body weight. Therefore, copepodite development was not isochronal. The rate of loss of body carbon by molting was small, ranging from 0.2 to 2\% day-1. This rate increased hyperbolically with food concentration and was linearly related to the growth rate. The critical food concentration for the rates of development and molting increased with temperature and stage of development, but these rates were less dependent on food concentration than the growth rate. The development rate of Pseudocalanus sp. was higher than that of C. pacificus, and was less influenced by changes in food concentration and temperature. It is postulated that the inverse relationship between temperature and body size results from a differential effect of temperature and body size on the rates of growth and development. That is, with increasing body size the growth rate tends to become temperature-independent, but the development rate remains proportional to temperature. Thus, copepodites growing at low temperature can experience a greater weight increment between molting periods than individuals growing at high temperature, because the growth rate is similar at all temperatures but stage duration is longer at low temperature.},

The individual molts into the next stage when the weight of the accumulated carapace building bricks is a fixed fraction of the body mass at the beginning of the stage. This simple stage-transition coordinating system is built into an individual growth model. The model predicts decreasing stage duration and increasing body weight with increasing food concentrations. These trends closely agree with published data. Anisochronality, as found in many copepod species, agrees with model predictions. Acartia species usually show isochronal development. The model predicts isochronal development for one particular value of a parameter of the feeding process. Literature data show that this parameter value is realistic for Acartia spp. “Equiproportionality” is predicted by the model. The model thus shows close agreement with observed growth and development patterns.},

Respiration rates in animals that had migrated down for the winter were not much lower than in those at the surface although energetic considerations suggest that they may decrease later.

Here, we examine differences in the protein configuration of two endemic Iberian freshwater fish species, Squalius carolitertii and the critically endangered S. torgalensis that inhabit in the Atlantic-type northern and in the Mediterranean-type southwestern regions, respectively. We performed protein structure modeling of fourteen genes linked to protein folding, energy metabolism, circadian rhythms and immune responses. Structural differences in proteins between the two species were found for HSC70, FKBP52, HIF1α and GPB1. For S. torgalensis, besides structural differences, we found higher thermostability for two proteins (HSP90 and GBP1), which can be advantageous in a warmer environment. Additionally, we investigated how these species might respond to projected scenarios of 3° climate change warming, acidification (ΔpH = -0.4), and their combined effects. Significant changes in gene expression were observed in response to all treatments, particularly under the combined warming and acidification. While S. carolitertii presented changes in gene expression for multiple proteins related to folding (hsp90aa1, hsc70, fkbp4 and stip1), only one such gene was altered in S. torgalensis (stip1). However, S. torgalensis showed a greater capacity for energy production under both the acidification and combined scenarios by increasing cs gene expression and maintaining ldha gene expression in muscle. Overall, these findings suggest that S. torgalensis is better prepared to cope with projected climate change. Worryingly, under the simulated scenarios, disturbances to circadian rhythm and immune system genes (cry1aa, per1a and gbp1) raise concerns for the persistence of both species, highlighting the need to consider multi-stressor effects when evaluating climate change impacts upon fish. This work also highlights that assessments of the potential of endangered freshwater species to cope with environmental change are crucial to help decision-makers adopt future conservation strategies.},

It also acts as an ecosystem engineer, affecting carbon sequestration and recycling iron and nitrogen, and has increasing importance as a commercial product in the aquaculture and health industries. Here we describe the creation of a de novo assembled head transcriptome for E. superba. As an example of its potential as a molecular resource, we relate its exploitation in identifying and characterizing numerous genes related to the circadian clock in E. superba, including the major components of the central feedback loop. We have made the transcriptome openly accessible for a wider audience of ecologists, molecular biologists, evolutionary geneticists, and others in a user-friendly format at SuperbaSE, hosted at www.krill.le.ac.uk.},

	abstract = {Use of the atomic O:N ratio as a metabolic index requires clarification of the biochemical complexities of zooplankton intermediary metabolism. We review the processes responsible for natural and experimentally-induced changes in the ratio and discuss their relative importance in relation to a variable natural environment. During starvation the O:N ratio is clearly linked to the availability of energy reserves and the use of body protein. Using theoretical computations, it can be shown that pure protein catabolism will yield O:N ratios in the range 3 to 16, while equal amounts of lipid and protein catabolism will correspond to values between 50 and 60. Under natural feeding conditions, the value of the ratio depends on the use by the animal of each biochemical fraction assimilated. Others factors, such as seasonal events in the life cycle, biochemical composition of the body and food quality are of importance for correct interpretation of the variations. The concepts behind the rates are discussed, suggesting that such measurements reflect the adaptability of the animals to their total environment.},

One of the most variable and unpredictable habitats on earth is the marine rocky intertidal zone located at the boundary between the terrestrial and marine environments. Mussels dominate rocky intertidal habitats throughout the world and, being sessile, endure wide variations in temperature, salinity, oxygen, and food availability due to diurnal, tidal, and climatic cycles. Analysis of gene-expression changes in the California ribbed mussel (Mytilus californianus) at different phases in the tidal cycle reveals that intertidal mussels exist in at least four distinct physiological states, corresponding to a metabolism and respiration phase, a cell-division phase, and two stress-response signatures linked to moderate and severe heat-stress events. The metabolism and cell-division phases appear to be functionally linked and are anticorrelated in time. The magnitudes and timings of these states varied by vertical position on the shore and appear to be driven by microhabitat conditions. The results provide new insights into the strategies that allow life to flourish in fluctuating environments and demonstrate the importance of time course data collected from field animals in situ in understanding organism-environment interactions.},

	abstract = {Background Circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology are the observable phenotypes from cycles in expression of, interactions between, and degradation of the underlying molecular components. In bilaterian animals, the core molecular components include Timeless-Timeout, photoreceptive cryptochromes, and several members of the basic-loop-helix-Per-ARNT-Sim (bHLH-PAS) family. While many of core circadian genes are conserved throughout the Bilateria, their specific roles vary among species. Here, we identify and experimentally study the rhythmic gene expression of conserved circadian clock members in a sea anemone in order to characterize this gene network in a member of the phylum Cnidaria and to infer critical components of the clockwork used in the last common ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians.  Methodology/Principal Findings We identified homologs of circadian regulatory genes in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, including a gene most similar to Timeout, three cryptochromes, and several key bHLH-PAS transcription factors. We then maintained N. vectensis either in complete darkness or in a 12 hour light: 12 hour dark cycle in three different light treatments (blue only, full spectrum, blue-depleted). Gene expression varied in response to light cycle and light treatment, with a particularly strong pattern observed for NvClock. The cryptochromes more closely related to the light-sensitive clade of cryptochromes were upregulated in light treatments that included blue wavelengths. With co-immunoprecipitation, we determined that heterodimerization between CLOCK and CYCLE is conserved within N. vectensis. Additionally, we identified E-box motifs, DNA sequences recognized by the CLOCK:CYCLE heterodimer, upstream of genes showing rhythmic expression.  Conclusions/Significance This study reveals conserved molecular and functional components of the circadian clock that were in place at the divergence of the Cnidaria and Bilateria, suggesting the animal circadian clockwork is more ancient than previous data suggest. Characterizing circadian regulation in a cnidarian provides insight into the early origins of animal circadian rhythms and molecular regulation of environmentally cued behaviors.},

Hypoxia increases mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation at Complex III, which causes accumulation of HIF-1α protein responsible for initiating expression of a luciferase reporter construct under the control of a hypoxic response element. This response is lost in cells depleted of mitochondrial DNA (ρ0 cells). Overexpression of catalase abolishes hypoxic response element-luciferase expression during hypoxia. Exogenous H2O2 stabilizes HIF-1α protein during normoxia and activates luciferase expression in wild-type and ρ0 cells. Isolated mitochondria increase ROS generation during hypoxia, as does the bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans. These findings reveal that mitochondria-derived ROS are both required and sufficient to initiate HIF-1α stabilization during hypoxia.},

	abstract = {The copepod species Calanus glacialis is an important component of arctic marine food webs, where it is the numerically dominant zooplankton grazer and serves as a major prey item for fish, seabirds, and other predators. These copepods are typically considered to be phytoplanktivorous, although they are also known to feed on microzooplankton, and little is known about their diet in fall and winter. To investigate their feeding, C. glacialis gut contents were analyzed over an annual cycle in a seasonally ice covered arctic fjord using next generation sequencing of 18S rDNA. During the spring bloom, diatoms, particularly Thalassiosira spp., were important contributors to the dietary sequence reads. In addition to diatoms, Chytridiomycetes, fungal parasites of diatoms, also made up a large proportion of dietary sequence reads during this productive season. This provides one of the first indications of the potential importance of the mycoloop in marine environments. Just prior to the spring bloom, chaetognath sequences dominated the prey sequence reads from C. glacialis, suggesting potential predation on eggs or other early life stages of chaetognaths by C. glacialis. Other indications of omnivorous feeding outside of the spring bloom period included sequence reads from polychaetes in summer, at the time of peak polychaete larval abundance, and from Metridia spp. (Copepoda) in winter in prey sequences from C. glacialis. Incorporating such predation into our knowledge of Calanus spp. behaviour may help refine our understanding of Calanus spp. ecology, and potential responses of C. glacialis to ongoing climate change.},

	abstract = {We compared six biochemical measures of nutritional condition: citrate synthase activity (CS), malate and lactate dehydrogenase activity (MDH and LDH), RNA:DNA ratio, and percent body protein and lipid. Adult females of five species of calanoid copepod (Calanoides acutus, Calanus propinquus, Metridia gerlachei, Rhincalanus gigas and Paraeuchaeta antarctica) were collected in the marginal ice zone of the northwestern Weddell Sea at the time of the annual phytoplankton bloom that occurs in association with the receding ice edge during austral spring. Three zones within the marginal ice zone were sampled: heavy-ice-cover pre-bloom, ice-edge bloom and low-ice-cover post-bloom. Lipid generally increased greatly from ice-covered to open water zones, and its importance in the life of polar copepods cannot be overstated. Increases in protein from ice-covered to open water were also observed, but were of less significance. Each species exhibited significant changes in at least one enzyme activity level. Citrate synthase activity in C. acutus, C. propinquus and R. gigas, all herbivores, increased between pre-and post-bloom stations. C. propinquus and M. gerlachei, which feed during winter, had large increases in LDH activity between pre- and post-bloom stations. Rhincalanus gigas and P. antarctica, the two largest species studied, showed variations in MDH activity, with peak enzyme activity occurring in post-bloom stations. RNA:DNA ratio did not change in any species. The effects of size, shipboard handling and freezer storage were easily corrected statistically, and did not alter any conclusions. The patterns observed in copepod nutrition at the Antarctic ice edge were consistent with existing models of life history for each species. The observations reported here, in conjunction with previously reported data, suggested that measurement of metabolic enzyme activity, especially in concert with lipid, enables estimation of nutritional condition in adult copepods. Additional studies comparing metabolic activity and ecology of common species should yield more information on the ecology of rarer species.},

	abstract = {We measured oxygen consumption rates, the activities of citrate synthase (CS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and protein contents for over 30 species of deep-sea pelagic Copepoda. The lowest oxygen consumption rates were measured in Euaugaptilus magnus and the highest rates were measured in Paraeuchaeta tonsa. Weight-specific oxygen consumption rates declined significantly with increasing size of the organism. None of the biochemical parameters were particularly good predictors of metabolic rate. Although linear regressions of LDH activity and protein content against oxygen consumption were statistically significant, R2 values for the relationships were very low. CS activity was not significantly correlated with metabolic rate. The highest CS activities were measured in Pleuromamma abdominalis and Calanus pacificus, which were the 2 smallest and shallowest-living species in our investigation. The lowest CS activities were measured in Euaugaptilus antarcticus and Pachyptilus pacificus. Disseta scopularis had the highest LDH activities and Onchocalanus magnus had the lowest LDH activities. Over all specimens, there were statistically significant increases in weight-specific activities of CS and LDH as a function of body mass. There was much greater variation in glycolytic potential as indicated by LDH activity than in CS activities. Epipelagic copepods apparently rely less on glycolytic energy sources than do mesopelagic and bathypelagic copepods. Higher LDH activities of larger Copepoda may indicate a greater dependence on LDH for burst swimming in large species compared with smaller ones or a reliance on glycolytic abilities for sustained swimming during vertical migrations. Our enzyme data do not support the suggestion that high LDH activities are adaptations to the very low oxygen concentrations found in the oxygen minimum layer. Enzymatic ratios were used to interpret lifestyle, and deep-sea copepods fell into 3 metabolic groups, 'muscular sinkers', 'thinmuscled floaters' and 'giants', that were related to morphological pattern and behaviour. The effect of hydrostatic pressure on the metabolic rate of an undescribed, but very common, species of Megacalanus was investigated and found to be non-significant. Copepods do not display the depth-related declines in metabolic rates that are found in shrimps, fishes and cephalopods.},

These rates were comparable to egg production rates observed in high-chlorophyll waters of the lower St. Lawrence estuary. Contrary to classical, linear food-chain models, variations in egg production of C. finmarchicus were therefore not predictable from variations in standing stocks of autotrophic cells. Egg production rates were independent of the concentration of chlorophyll in situ, the abundance of autotrophic microplankton cells, in situ gut fluorescence, and the rate of ingestion of autotrophic particles. Heterotrophic microplankton—including ciliates and dinoflagellates presumed to be heterotrophic—constituted a disproportionate fraction of the ration of C. finmarchicus in the open Gulf of St. Lawrence, despite their relatively low cell densities. Evidence suggests that heterotrophic microplankton frequently provided a prey resource sufficient for net lipid synthesis as well as for egg production.},

Previous studies suggest the species is vulnerable to the effects of global warming, particularly on the Northeast U.S. Shelf, which is in the southern portion of its range. In this study, we evaluate an ensemble of six different downscaled climate models and a high-resolution global climate model, and create a generalized additive model (GAM) to examine how future changes in temperature and salinity could affect the distribution and density of C. finmarchicus. By 2081–2100, we project average C. finmarchicus density will decrease by as much as 50\% under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario. These decreases are particularly pronounced in the spring and summer in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank. When compared to a high-resolution global climate model, the ensemble showed a more uniform change throughout the Northeast U.S. Shelf, while the high-resolution model showed larger decreases in the Northeast Channel, Shelf Break, and Central Gulf of Maine. C. finmarchicus is an important link between primary production and higher trophic levels, and the decrease projected here could be detrimental to the North Atlantic Right Whale and a host of important fishery species.},

	abstract = {Generalized additive models have the form η(x) = α + σ fj (x j ), where η might be the regression function in a multiple regression or the logistic transformation of the posterior probability Pr(y = 1 {\textbar} x) in a logistic regression. In fact, these models generalize the whole family of generalized linear models η(x) = β′x, where η(x) = g(μ(x)) is some transformation of the regression function. We use the local scoring algorithm to estimate the functions fj (xj ) nonparametrically, using a scatterplot smoother as a building block. We demonstrate the models in two different analyses: a nonparametric analysis of covariance and a logistic regression. The procedure can be used as a diagnostic tool for identifying parametric transformations of the covariates in a standard linear analysis. A variety of inferential tools have been developed to aid the analyst in assessing the relevance and significance of the estimated functions: these include confidence curves, degrees of freedom estimates, and approximate hypothesis tests. The local scoring algorithm is analogous to the iterative reweighted least squares algorithm for solving likelihood and nonlinear regression equations. At each iteration, an adjusted dependent variable is formed and an additive regression model is fit using the backfitting algorithm. The backfitting algorithm cycles through the variables and estimates each coordinated function by smoothing the partial residuals.},

	abstract = {One of the needs of the Pelagos Sanctuary for the Conservation of Mediterranean Marine Mammals is information on critical habitats for cetaceans. This study modelled habitat use and preferences of fin whales and striped dolphins (the two most abundant species in the area) with the aim of providing this information, using sighting data collected between 1993 and 1999. The study area was divided into a 2′ latitude by 2′ longitude grid. The explanatory variables considered in the models were physiographic variables (mean, range and standard deviation of depth and slope, and distance from the nearest coastline) and remotely-sensed data (Sea Surface Temperature and Chlorophyll-a concentration). The former were calculated for each cell using GIS tools, while the latter were obtained from AVHRR and SeaWiFS sensors. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with multidimensional smoothers were used to model the distribution of fin whales and striped dolphins in relation to these variables, and Classification And Regression Trees were used for habitat characterization and predictive models. The GAMs were coupled with Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) to account for temporal autocorrelation in the errors and to help ensure model selection was reliable; the QIC statistic was used alongside GEE-based p-values. Bathymetric features were the most valuable predictors in the Pelagos Sanctuary area for both species. Sea Surface Temperature values were indicators of striped dolphin and fin whale presence, with both species showing a tendency to prefer colder waters (21–24 °C). Chl-a levels were selected by the GAM models only for striped dolphins, and with large associated uncertainty; this may be related to the relatively brief period examined (only 2 years) and/or to any functional relationship operating at a different geographical or temporal scale. The boosted classification trees however indicated an importance of Chl-a for both species. The techniques applied to this dataset proved to be valuable tools to describe habitat use and preferences of cetaceans, and the use of the remotely-sensed data can substantially improve the predictions. The results of this study will be used for assessing critical habitats within the Pelagos Sanctuary and will provide information for conservation and management in the Sanctuary.},

	abstract = {A resource selection function (RSF) is any model that yields values proportional to the probability of use of a resource unit. RSF models often are fitted using generalized linear models (GLMs) although a variety of statistical models might be used. Information criteria such as the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) are tools that can be useful for selecting a model from a set of biologically plausible candidates. Statistical inference procedures, such as the likelihood-ratio test, can be used to assess whether models deviate from random null models. But for most applications of RSF models, usefulness is evaluated by how well the model predicts the location of organisms on a landscape. Predictions from RSF models constructed using presence/absence (used/unused) data can be evaluated using procedures developed for logistic regression, such as confusion matrices, Kappa statistics, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. However, RSF models estimated from presence/available data create unique problems for evaluating model predictions. For presence/available models we propose a form of k-fold cross validation for evaluating prediction success. This involves calculating the correlation between RSF ranks and area-adjusted frequencies for a withheld sub-sample of data. A similar approach can be applied to evaluate predictive success for out-of-sample data. Not all RSF models are robust for application in different times or different places due to ecological and behavioral variation of the target organisms.},

	abstract = {Aims To show how logistic regression models for individual species can be used to produce improved estimates of species richness at a continental scale; to present these data for African ticks (Acari: Ixodida); and to address the question of whether there is a latitudinal gradient in tick species richness. Location Africa. Methods A database of 34,060 collection records for African ticks is used to produce a pan-African map of known tick species richness at 0.25 × 0.25-degree resolution. The likely distributions of seventy-three species are then estimated from environmental factors using logistic regression, and localities where there is a suitably high probability of occurrence for a given species are added to the original data for that species. These augmented data are combined to produce a map of the predicted pan-African distribution of tick species richness. The relationship of species richness to latitude is considered along a transect placed across some of the more extensively collected areas. Results Maps of known and predicted pan-African tick species richness are presented, and deficiencies in the available data are highlighted. Correlations using both known and predicted estimates of tick species richness suggest that ticks follow similar species richness patterns to those described for African mammals and birds, with a latitudinal gradient and highest species richness in east equatorial Africa. Tick species ranges are log-normally distributed. Main conclusions Carefully constructed probability surfaces offer a more powerful approach to mapping species ranges than simple presence-absence maps. Such models are a useful extension to current biogeographical methods and have a wide range of potential applications in ecology, epidemiology and conservation. Tick species richness at a continental scale follows similar trends to those reported for mammals and birds.},

We examined stages of tooth formation inNeocalanus spp. andCalanus pacificus. Apolysis occurs early in the distal gnathobase, then several epidermal cell types participate sequentially in formation of new teeth. Fibrous molds in the shapes of the new teeth are extruded onto the epidermal surface, then additional materials, probably proteinaceous, are secreted into them. Tooth molds next are linked to a gland in the proximal part of the gnathobase by ducts of an unusual type, “lamellar-walled ducts.” Silicification follows, apparently using highly osmiophilic material supplied by the proximal gland. Opal is laid down at the outer periphery of the mold then thickens toward the attachment of the mold to newly formed chitin at its base. During apolysis the epidermal cells move proximally without breaking ducts that connect small dermal glands with pores in the sides of the opal teeth. The molds for the new teeth form surrounding these ducts, and new pores result. The glands are like the ciliary exocrine glands seen in other Crustacea, with the duct deriving from fusion of the axonemes of a cilium. Presumably the glands secrete a substance into food newly broken by the teeth. This could be a toxin or a digestive enzyme.},

To date, it remains unknown how this rhythm is controlled endogenously, although there must be coordination of circadian manners.

We investigated circadian rhythms of melatonin secretion, ghrh and ss expressions, and correlation between melatonin with growth-related genes in tiger puffer Takifugu rubripes. The melatonin secretion showed nocturnal rhythms under light and dark (LD) conditions. In constant light (LL) condition, melatonin secretion has similar patterns with LD conditions. ss1 mRNA was high during scotophase under LD conditions. But ss1 rhythms disappeared in LL conditions. Ghrh appeared opposite expression compared with melatonin levels or ss1 expression under LD and LL. In the results of the melatonin injection, ghrh and ss1 showed no significant expression compared with control groups. These results suggested that melatonin and growth-related genes have daily or circadian rhythms in the tiger puffer. Further, we need to know mechanisms of each ss and ghrh gene regulation.},

It was discovered in 1999, when studying α-oxidation of phytanic acid. HACL1 has an important role in at least two pathways: (i) the degradation of 3-methyl-branched fatty acids like phytanic acid and (ii) the shortening of 2-hydroxy long-chain fatty acids. In both cases, HACL1 catalyses the cleavage step, which involves the splitting of a carbon–carbon bond between the first and second carbon atom in a 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediate leading to the production of an (n−1) aldehyde and formyl-CoA. The latter is rapidly converted into formate and subsequently to CO2. HACL1 is a homotetramer and has a PTS (peroxisomal targeting signal) at the C-terminal side (PTS1). No deficiency of HACL1 has been described yet in human, but thiamin deficiency might affect its activity.},

Photoperiodism is especially important in initiating physiological and developmental processes that are typically irrevocable and that culminate at a future time or at a distant place; the further away in space or time, the more likely a seasonal event is initiated by photoperiod. The pervasiveness of photoperiodism across broad taxa, from rotifers to rodents, and the predictable changes of photoperiodic response with geography identify it as a central component of fitness in temperate and polar seasonal environments. Consequently, the role of day length cannot be disregarded when evaluating the mechanisms underlying life-historical events, range expansions, invasions of novel species, and response to climate change among animals in the temperate and polar regions of the world.},

	abstract = {Ocean acidification is the increase in seawater pCO2 due to the uptake of atmospheric anthropogenic CO2, with the largest changes predicted to occur in the Arctic seas. For some marine organisms, this change in pCO2, and associated decrease in pH, represents a climate change-related stressor. In this study, we investigated the gene expression patterns of nauplii of the Arctic copepod Calanus glacialis cultured at low pH levels. We have previously shown that organismal-level performance (development, growth, respiration) of C. glacialis nauplii is unaffected by low pH. Here, we investigated the molecular-level response to lowered pH in order to elucidate the physiological processes involved in this tolerance. Nauplii from wild-caught C. glacialis were cultured at four pH levels (8.05, 7.9, 7.7, 7.5). At stage N6, mRNA was extracted and sequenced using RNA-seq. The physiological functionality of the proteins identified was categorized using Gene Ontology and KEGG pathways. We found that the expression of 151 contigs varied significantly with pH on a continuous scale (93\% downregulated with decreasing pH). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that, of the processes downregulated, many were components of the universal cellular stress response, including DNA repair, redox regulation, protein folding, and proteolysis. Sodium:proton antiporters were among the processes significantly upregulated, indicating that these ion pumps were involved in maintaining cellular pH homeostasis. C. glacialis significantly alters its gene expression at low pH, although they maintain normal larval development. Understanding what confers tolerance to some species will support our ability to predict the effects of future ocean acidification on marine organisms.},

	abstract = {Climate change-related alterations of Antarctic sea-ice habitats will significantly impact the interaction of ice-associated organisms with the environment, with repercussions on ecosystem functioning. The nature of this interaction is poorly understood, particularly during the critical period of winter–spring transition. To investigate the role of sea-ice and underlying water-column properties in structuring under-ice communities during late winter/early spring, we used a Surface and Under Ice Trawl to sample animals and environmental properties in the upper 2-m layer under the sea ice in the northern Weddell Sea from August to October 2013. The area of investigation was largely homogeneous in terms of hydrography and sea-ice coverage. We hypothesised that this apparent homogeneity in the physical regime was mirrored in the structure of the under-ice community. The under-ice community was numerically dominated by the copepods Stephos longipes, Ctenocalanus spp. and Calanus propinquus (altogether 67 \%), and furcilia larvae of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba (30 \%). In spite of the apparent homogeneity of the environment, abundance and biomass distributions at our sampling stations indicated the presence of three community types, following a geographical gradient in the investigation area: (1) high biomass, krill-dominated in the west, (2) high abundance, copepod-dominated in the east, and (3) low abundance, low biomass at the ice edge. Combined analysis with environmental data indicated that under-ice community structure was correlated with sea-ice coverage, chlorophyll a concentration, and bottom depth. The heterogeneity of the Antarctic under-ice community was probably also driven by other factors, such as advection, sea-ice drift, and seasonal progression. The response of under-ice communities to changing sea-ice habitats may thus considerably vary seasonally and regionally.},

Here we provide an unprecedented view of ice algal biomass distribution, mapped (as chlorophyll a) in a 100 m by 100 m area of a Weddell Sea pack ice floe, using under-ice irradiance measurements taken with an instrumented remotely operated vehicle. We identified significant correlations (p {\textless} 0.001) between algal biomass and concomitant in situ surface measurements of snow depth, ice thickness, and estimated sea ice freeboard levels using a statistical model. The model's explanatory power (r2 = 0.30) indicates that these parameters alone may provide a first basis for spatial prediction of ice algal biomass, but parameterization of additional determinants is needed to inform more robust upscaling efforts.},

	abstract = {Circadian repression of CLOCK-BMAL1 by PERIOD and CRYPTOCHROME (CRY) in mammals lies at the core of the circadian timekeeping mechanism. CRY repression of CLOCK-BMAL1 and regulation of circadian period are proposed to rely primarily on competition for binding with coactivators on an α-helix located within the transactivation domain (TAD) of the BMAL1 C terminus. This model has, however, not been tested in vivo. Here, we applied CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis in the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), which possesses a vertebrate-like CRY (dpCRY2) and an ortholog of BMAL1, to show that insect CRY2 regulates circadian repression through TAD α-helix–dependent and –independent mechanisms. Monarch mutants lacking the BMAL1 C terminus including the TAD exhibited arrhythmic eclosion behavior. In contrast, mutants lacking the TAD α-helix but retaining the most distal C-terminal residues exhibited robust rhythms during the first day of constant darkness (DD1), albeit with a delayed peak of eclosion. Phase delay in this mutant on DD1 was exacerbated in the presence of a single functional allele of dpCry2, and rhythmicity was abolished in the absence of dpCRY2. Reporter assays in Drosophila S2 cells further revealed that dpCRY2 represses through two distinct mechanisms: a TAD-dependent mechanism that involves the dpBMAL1 TAD α-helix and dpCLK W328 and a TAD-independent mechanism involving dpCLK E333. Together, our results provide evidence for independent mechanisms of vertebrate-like CRY circadian regulation on the BMAL1 C terminus and the CLK PAS-B domain and demonstrate the importance of a BMAL1 TAD-independent mechanism for generating circadian rhythms in vivo.},

The same photoperiod produced advances in the time of spawning of up to 232 days and delays of up to 80 days, depending upon the timing of exposure in relation to the phase of the reproductive cycle. The proportion of fish spawning in each group varied from 18\% to 100\%, again dependent on the timing of exposure to continuous light. The photoperiod-induced changes in spawning time can be interpreted as phase-dependent phase-shifts of an endogenous circannual clock controlling maturation. It is proposed that long days, occurring earlier or later than they would under a natural photoperiod, were perceived as indications that the clock was running slow or fast, thus initiating corrective forward adjustments (advance phase-shifts) or backward adjustments (delay phase-shifts), respectively. Collectively, these responses can be described in the form of a circannual phase–response curve.},

Those environmental changes may modify the planktonic ecosystem with changes from lower to upper trophic levels. This study aimed to understand how the biogeographic distribution of a crucial endemic copepod species, Calanus glacialis, may respond to both abiotic (ocean temperature) and biotic (phytoplankton prey) drivers. A copepod individual-based model coupled to an ice-ocean-biogeochemical model was utilized to simulate temperature- and food-dependent life cycle development of C. glacialis annually from 1980 to 2014. Over the 35-year study period, the northern boundaries of modeled diapausing C. glacialis expanded poleward and the annual success rates of C. glacialis individuals attaining diapause in a circumpolar transition zone increased substantially. Those patterns could be explained by a lengthening growth season (during which time food is ample) and shortening critical development time (the period from the first feeding stage N3 to the diapausing stage C4). The biogeographic changes were further linked to large scale oceanic processes, particularly diminishing sea ice cover, upper ocean warming, and increasing and prolonging food availability, which could have potential consequences to the entire Arctic shelf/slope marine ecosystems.

	abstract = {Copepods, small planktonic crustaceans, are key links between primary producers and upper trophic levels, including many economically important fishes. In the subarctic North Pacific, the life cycle of copepods like Neocalanus flemingeri includes an ontogenetic migration to depth followed by a period of diapause (a type of dormancy) characterized by arrested development and low metabolic activity. The end of diapause is marked by the production of the first brood of eggs. Recent temperature anomalies in the North Pacific have raised concerns about potential negative effects on N. flemingeri. Since diapause is a developmental program, its progress can be tracked using through global gene expression. Thus, a reference transcriptome was developed as a first step towards physiological profiling of diapausing females using high-throughput Illumina sequencing. The de novo transcriptome, the first for this species was designed to investigate the diapause period. RNA-Seq reads were obtained for dormant to reproductive N. flemingeri females. A high quality de novo transcriptome was obtained by first assembling reads from each individual using Trinity software followed by clustering with CAP3 Assembly Program. This assembly consisted of 140,841transcripts (contigs). Bench-marking universal single-copy orthologs analysis identified 85\% of core eukaryotic genes, with 79\% predicted to be complete. Comparison with other calanoid transcriptomes confirmed its quality and degree of completeness. Trinity assembly of reads originating from multiple individuals led to fragmentation. Thus, the workflow applied here differed from the one recommended by Trinity, but was required to obtain a good assembly.},

Considering that the distribution of C. glacialis corresponds to Arctic water masses and C. finmarchicus to Atlantic water masses, the species are frequently used as climate indicators. Consequently, correct identification of the two species is essential if we want to understand climate-impacted changes on Calanus-dominated marine ecosystems such as the Arctic. Here, we present a novel morphological character (redness) to distinguish live females of C. glacialis and C. finmarchicus and compare it to morphological (prosome length) and genetic identification. The characters are tested on 300 live females of C. glacialis and C. finmarchicus from Disko Bay, western Greenland. Our analysis confirms that length cannot be used as a stand-alone criterion for separation. The results based on the new morphological character were verified genetically using a single mitochondrial marker (16S) and nuclear loci (six microsatellites and 12 InDels). The pigmentation criterion was also used on individuals (n = 89) from Young Sound fjord, northeast Greenland to determine whether the technique was viable in different geographical locations. Genetic markers based on mitochondrial and nuclear loci were corroborative in their identification of individuals and revealed no hybrids. Molecular identification confirmed that live females of the two species from Greenlandic waters, both East and West, can easily be separated by the red pigmentation of the antenna and somites of C. glacialis in contrast to the pale opaque antenna and somites of C. finmarchicus, confirming that the pigmentation criterion is valid for separation of the two species.},

	abstract = {The condition and survival of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) strongly depends on sea ice conditions during winter. How krill utilize sea ice depends on several factors such as region and developmental stage. A comprehensive understanding of sea ice habitat use by krill, however, remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to improve the understanding of the krill’s interaction with the sea ice habitat during winter/early spring by conducting large-scale sampling of the ice–water interface (0–2 m) and comparing the size and developmental stage composition of krill with the pelagic population (0–500 m). Results show that the population in the northern Weddell Sea consisted mainly of krill that were {\textless}1 year old (age class 0; AC0), and that it was comprised of multiple cohorts. Size per developmental stage differed spatially, indicating that the krill likely were advected from various origins. The size distribution of krill differed between the two depth strata sampled. Larval stages with a relatively small size (mean 7–8 mm) dominated the upper two metre layer of the water column, while larger larvae and AC0 juveniles (mean 14–15 mm) were proportionally more abundant in the 0- to 500-m stratum. Our results show that, as krill mature, their vertical distribution and utilization of the sea ice appear to change gradually. This could be the result of changes in physiology and/or behaviour, as, e.g., the krill’s energy demand and swimming capacity increase with size and age. The degree of sea ice association will have an effect on large-scale spatial distribution patterns of AC0 krill and on predictions of the consequences of sea ice decline on their survival over winter.},

However, while extensive research illustrates the harmful effects of inappropriate light exposure on biological timing in humans, rodents and birds, comparable studies on marine fish are virtually nonexistent. This study aimed to assess the effects of light on biological clock function in the marine fish retina using the Atlantic tarpon (Megalops atlanticus) as a model. Using anti-opsin immunofluorescence, we observed robust rhythms of photoreceptor outer segment position (retinomotor movement) over the course of the daily light–dark cycle: cone outer segments were contracted toward the inner retina and rods were elongated during the day; the opposite occurred at night. Phase shifting the daily light–dark cycle caused a corresponding shift of retinomotor movement timing, and cone retinomotor movement persisted in constant darkness, indicating control by a circadian clock. Constant light abolished retinomotor movements of both photoreceptor types. Thus, abnormally-timed light exposure may disrupt normal M. atlanticus clock function and harm vision, which in turn may affect prey capture and predator avoidance. These results should help inform efforts to mitigate the effects of coastal light pollution on organisms in marine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The Northern krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica is a significant component of the zooplankton community in many regions of the North Atlantic Ocean. In the areas it inhabits, M. norvegica is of great importance ecologically, as it is both a major consumer of phytoplankton/small zooplankton and is a primary food source for higher-level consumers. One behavior of significance for both feeding and predator avoidance in Meganyctiphanes is diel vertical migration (DVM), i.e., a rising from depth at dusk and a return to depth at dawn. In this and other euphausiids, an endogenous circadian pacemaker is thought, at least in part, to control DVM. Currently, there is no information concerning the identity of the genes/proteins that comprise the M. norvegica circadian system. In fact, there is little information concerning the molecular underpinnings of circadian rhythmicity in crustaceans generally. Here, a publicly accessible transcriptome was used to identify the molecular components of a putative Meganyctiphanes circadian system. A complete set of core clock proteins was deduced from the M. norvegica transcriptome (clock, cryptochrome 2, cycle, period and timeless), as was a large suite of proteins that likely function as modulators of the core clock (e.g., doubletime), or serves as inputs to it (cryptochrome 1) or outputs from it (pigment dispersing hormone). This is the first description of a “complete” (core clock through putative output pathway signals) euphausiid clock system, and as such, provides a foundation for initiating molecular investigations of circadian signaling in M. norvegica and other krill species, including how clock systems may regulate DVM and other behaviors.},

	abstract = {Summary
Desert biological soil crusts (BSC), among the harshest environments on Earth, are formed by the adhesion of soil particles to polysaccharides excreted mainly by filamentous cyanobacteria (see [1] and references therein). These species are the main primary producers in this habitat where they cope with various stressors including frequent hydration–dehydration cycles. Water is mainly provided as early-morning dew, followed by dehydration with rising temperatures and declining relative humidity. Earlier studies focused on community structure and cyanobacterial activities in various BSCs [1,2]. They identified genes present in dehydration-tolerant, but not -sensitive cyanobacteria [3], and suggested that abiotic conditions during natural dehydration (Figure 1A) are critical for the recovery upon rewetting. Inability of Leptolyngbya ohadii, which is abundant in the BSC examined here, to recover after rapid desiccation (Figure 1B) [4] suggested that the cells must prepare themselves toward forthcoming dehydration, but the nature of the signal involved was unknown. We show here that the rising dawn illumination, perceived by photo-sensors, serves as the signal inciting BSC-inhabiting cyanobacteria to prepare for forthcoming dehydration. L. ohadii filaments were exposed to simulated natural conditions from the morning of October 14th 2009, using our environmental chamber that enables accurate reproduction of BSC environment [4] (Supplemental Figure S1A). Samples were withdrawn at specific time points (Figure 1A), followed by RNA extraction and global transcript profiling (accession PRJNA391854). Four hours of dehydration led to up-regulation of 567 genes and down-regulation of 1597 (by more than 2-fold). Since BSC-inhabiting organisms have not been used as genetic models, the functions of 3258 (43.5\% of the 7487 L. ohadii genes [3]) are unknown. Nevertheless, a pronounced rise in transcript levels of genes involved in carbon metabolism, transport, osmolyte production, energy dissipation and other cellular activities was observed. On the other hand, a declining transcript abundance for genes involved in light harvesting, photosynthetic metabolism, protein biosynthesis, cell division and other pathways was detected. The analysis unraveled clear distinctions between early- and late-responding genes. Supplemental Table S1 lists the 40 strongest differentially expressed genes verified by RT-qPCR and used in further analyses.},

	abstract = {Marine organisms adapt to complex temporal environments that include daily, tidal, semi-lunar, lunar and seasonal cycles. However, our understanding of marine biological rhythms and their underlying molecular basis is mainly confined to a few model organisms in rather simplistic laboratory settings. Here, we use new empirical data and recent examples of marine biorhythms to highlight how field ecologists and laboratory chronobiologists can complement each other's efforts. First, with continuous tracking of intertidal shorebirds in the field, we reveal individual differences in tidal and circadian foraging rhythms. Second, we demonstrate that shorebird species that spend 8–10 months in tidal environments rarely maintain such tidal or circadian rhythms during breeding, likely because of other, more pertinent, temporally structured, local ecological pressures such as predation or social environment. Finally, we use examples of initial findings from invertebrates (arthropods and polychaete worms) that are being developed as model species to study the molecular bases of lunar-related rhythms. These examples indicate that canonical circadian clock genes (i.e. the homologous clock genes identified in many higher organisms) may not be involved in lunar/tidal phenotypes. Together, our results and the examples we describe emphasize that linking field and laboratory studies is likely to generate a better ecological appreciation of lunar-related rhythms in the wild.

	abstract = {The circadian clock is a molecular network that coordinates organismal behavior and physiology with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. In eumetazoans (bilaterians + cnidarians), this network appears to be largely conserved, yet different from other known eukaryotic circadian networks. To determine if the eumetazoan circadian network has an older origin, we ask here whether orthologues comprising this network are expressed in a manner consistent with a role in regulating circadian patterns in a representative of an earlier-branching animal lineage, the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica. The A. queenslandica genome encodes orthologues of many eumetazoan circadian genes, including two cryptochrome genes that encode flavoproteins, three Timeout genes, and two PAR-bZIP and seven bHLH-PAS transcription factor genes. There is no apparent Cycle orthologue, although we can identify three closely related ARNT genes. Of the putative circadian genes, only AqPARa and AqCry2 have a consistent oscillating diurnal expression profile, and the rhythmic expression of both these genes is partially lost when the animals are exposed to constant light or darkness. Expression of the other putative circadian genes, in particular AqClock, is neither diurnally-oscillating nor light-dependent. AqPARa and AqCry2 are also temporally and spatially co-expressed throughout embryonic and larval development. Transcripts of these genes are enriched first in cells comprising the larval posterior pigment ring, which is a simple photosensory organ that is responsible for the negative phototactic behaviour displayed by larvae, and subsequently in the larval epithelial and subepithelial layers. The combined findings of no clear Cycle orthologue and of PAR-bZIP and cryptochrome being the only orthologues expressed in a pattern consistent with a circadian role suggests that either (i) the ancestral metazoan circadian network was simpler than the eumetazoan network, or (ii) that this sponge has lost some components, as has occurred in some other animals such as Hydra.},

In this study, a high-density oligonucleotide microarray was used to examine the daily expression of 13,939 unique genes in whole gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) larvae with fast growth potentiality. Up to 2,229 genes were differentially expressed, and the first two components of Principal Component Analysis explained more than 81\% of the total variance. Clustering analysis of differentially expressed genes identified 4 major clusters that were triggered sequentially, with a maximum expression at 0 h, 3 h, 9–15 h and 18-21 h zeitgeber time. Various core clock genes (per1, per2, per3, bmal1, cry1, cry2, clock) were identified in clusters 1–3, and their expression was significantly correlated with several genes in each cluster. Functional analysis revealed a daily consecutive activation of canonical pathways related to phototransduction, intermediary metabolism, development, chromatin remodeling, and cell cycle regulation. This daily transcriptome of whole larvae resembles a cell cycle (G1/S, G2/M, and M/G1 transitions) in synchronization with multicellular processes, such as neuromuscular development. This study supports that the actively feeding fish larval transcriptome is temporally organized in a 24-h cycle, likely for maximizing growth and development.},

The diel vertical migration (DVM) of small polar cod was precisely synchronized with the light/dark cycle and its duration tracked the seasonal lengthening of the photoperiod. The DVM stopped in May coincident with the midnight sun and increased schooling and feeding. We propose that foraging interference and a limited prey supply in the deep aggregation drove the upward re-distribution of small polar cod at night. The bioluminescent copepod Metridia longa could have provided the light needed by polar cod to feed on copepods in the deep aphotic layers.},

Incorrect growth models, specifically those giving unrealistically high production, could lead to over-exploitation of the krill population if those models are used in setting catch limits. Here we review available approaches to modelling productivity and note that existing models do not account for the interactions between growth and reproduction and variable environmental conditions. We develop a new energetics moult-cycle (EMC) model which combines energetics and the constraints on growth of the moult-cycle. This model flexibly accounts for regional, inter- and intra-annual variation in temperature, food supply, and day length. The EMC model provides results consistent with the general expectations for krill growth in length and mass, including having thin krill, as well as providing insights into the effects that increasing temperature may have on growth and reproduction. We recommend that this new model be incorporated into assessments of catch limits for Antarctic krill.},

Eight Svalbard ptarmigan were caged outdoors at 70°N and blood sampled throughout one day each month for 13 months. At this latitude, daylight is continuous between May and August, but there is a short period of civil twilight around noon from late November to mid January. There was no daily rhythm in plasma melatonin in May-July. Plasma melatonin levels varied significantly throughout the day in all other months of the year, with the nighttime increase reflecting the duration of darkness. The highest mean plasma concentration occurred at midnight in March (110.1 ± 16.5 pg/ml) and represented the annual peak in estimated daily production. Around the winter solstice, melatonin levels were significantly reduced at noon and elevated during the nearly 18 h of consecutive darkness, and the estimated mean daily production of melatonin was significantly reduced. Thus, at the times of the year characterized by light-dark cycles, melatonin may convey information concerning the length of the day and, therefore, progression of season. The nearly undetectable low melatonin secretion in summer and the reduced amplitude and production in midwinter indicate a flexible circadian system that may reflect an important adaptation to life in the Arctic.},

However, various computational methods adopting different strategies for the identification of cycling transcripts usually yield inconsistent results even for the same dataset, making it challenging to choose the optimal method for a specific circadian study. To address this challenge, we evaluate 5 popular methods, including ARSER (ARS), COSOPT (COS), Fisher’s G test (FIS), HAYSTACK (HAY), and JTK\_CYCLE (JTK), based on both simulated and empirical datasets. Our results show that increasing the number of total samples (through improving sampling frequency or lengthening the sampling time window) is beneficial for computational methods to accurately identify circadian transcripts and measure circadian phase. For a given number of total samples, higher sampling frequency is more important for HAY and JTK, and the longer sampling time window is more crucial for ARS and COS, as testified on simulated and empirical datasets from which circadian signals are computationally identified. In addition, the preference of higher sampling frequency or the longer sampling time window is also obvious for JTK, ARS, and COS in estimating circadian phases of simulated periodic profiles. Our results also indicate that attention should be paid to the significance threshold that is used for each method in selecting circadian genes, especially when analyzing the same empirical dataset with 2 or more methods. To summarize, for any study involving genome-wide identification of circadian genes from transcriptome data, our evaluation results provide suggestions for the selection of an optimal method based on specific goal and experimental design.},

	abstract = {In this work, we study if ploidy (i.e. number of copies of chromosomes) in the oyster Crassostrea gigas may introduce differences in behavior and in its synchronization by the annual photoperiod. To answer to the question about the effect of the seasonal course of the photoperiod on the behavior of C. gigas according to its ploidy, we quantified valve activity by HFNI valvometry in situ for 1 year in both diploid and triploid oysters. Chronobiological analyses of daily, tidal and lunar rhythms were performed according the annual change of the photoperiod. In parallel, growth and gametogenesis status were measured and spawning events were detected by valvometry. The results showed that triploids had reduced gametogenesis, without spawning events, and approximately three times more growth than diploids. These differences in physiological efforts could explain the result that photoperiod (daylength and/or direction of daylength) differentially drives and modulates seasonal behavior of diploid and triploid oysters. Most differences were observed during long days (spring and summer), where triploids showed longer valve opening duration but lower opening amplitude, stronger daily rhythm and weaker tidal rhythm. During this period, diploids did major gametogenesis and spawning whereas triploids did maximal growth. Differences were also observed in terms of moonlight rhythmicity and neap-spring tidal cycle rhythmicity. We suggest that the seasonal change of photoperiod differentially synchronizes oyster behavior and biological rhythms according to physiological needs based on ploidy.},

Recently, silencing target genes by feeding has been successfully carried out in nematodes, insects, and small aquatic organisms. A non-invasive feeding-based RNA interference is reported here for the first time in a mollusk bivalve, the pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. In this Trojan horse strategy, the unicellular alga Heterocapsa triquetra is the food supply used as a vector to feed oysters with Escherichia coli strain HT115 engineered to express the double-stranded RNA targeting gene. To test the efficacy of the method, the Clock gene, a central gene of the circadian clock, was targeted for knockout. Results demonstrated specific and systemic efficiency of the Trojan horse strategy in reducing Clock mRNA abundance. Consequences of Clock disruption were observed in Clock-related genes (Bmal, Tim1, Per, Cry1, Cry2, Rev.-erb, and Ror) and triploid oysters were more sensitive than diploid to the interference. This non-invasive approach shows an involvement of the circadian clock in oyster bioaccumulation of toxins produced by the harmful alga Alexandrium minutum.},

	abstract = {Physiological characteristics (egg production, lipid content and gonad development stage) of Calanus finmarchicus were examined on five cruises in the north-east Atlantic carried out between the months of October to March in the years 1993–95 and related to phytoplankton food availability. Appreciable egg production rates were only recorded in October and March. Published values for maximum water volume filtered daily by individual females and the standing stock of phytoplankton (estimated from chlorophyll concentration) are used to argue that ingestion of phytoplankton carbon alone was not sufficient to support the egg production rates recorded in March. Data are presented that indicate C. finmarchicus is fuelling egg production through use of internal lipids. We argue that this species exhibits a life history strategy whereby females release a limited number of eggs to the water column upon returning to the surface waters following diapause, i.e. prior to the onset of the spring bloom. This pre-spring bloom egg production will comprise only a small component of the annual Calanus egg production in shelf waters. Nevertheless, given that the recruitment of Calanus to their feeding grounds over the shelf is a function of transport of the copepods from off-shelf to shelf regions via ocean currents, a burst of egg production in the period immediately following diapause and prior to the population's transport to shelf waters, would increase the chances of large numbers of the population reaching shelf regions. Thus, even a limited pre-spring bloom burst of egg production may have important consequences for recruitment in this species.},

Significant trends towards earlier phytoplankton blooms were detected in about 11\% of the area of the Arctic Ocean with valid Chl data, e.g. in the Hudson Bay, Foxe Basin, Baffin Sea, off the coasts of Greenland, in the Kara Sea and around Novaya Zemlya. These areas roughly coincide with areas where ice concentration has decreased in early summer (June), thus making the earlier blooms possible. In the selected areas, the annual phytoplankton bloom maximum has advanced by up to 50 days which may have consequences for the Arctic food chain and carbon cycling. Outside the Arctic, the annual Chl maximum has become earlier in boreal North Pacific but later in the North Atlantic.},

We studied the overall abundance and population structure of the North Atlantic keystone zooplankton copepod Calanus finmarchicus, which is the main prey for pelagic fish and some seabirds, in relation to selected environmental variables in this area between 2001 and 2011, when warming in the Arctic and Subarctic was particularly pronounced. Sampling within a 3-week time window each summer demonstrated that trends in the overall abundance of C. finmarchicus varied between years, with the highest values in “extreme” years, due to high numbers of nauplii and early copepodite stages in colder years (2001, 2004, 2010), and contrary to that, the fifth copepodite stage (C5) peaking in warm years (2006, 2007, 2009). The most influential environmental variable driving C. finmarchicus life cycle was temperature, which promoted an increased C5 abundance when the temperature was above 6°C, indicating earlier spawning and/or accelerated development, and possibly leading to their development to adults later in the summer and spawning for the second time, given adequate food supply. Based on the presented high interannual and spatial variability, we hypothesize that under a warmer climate, C. finmarchicus may annually produce two generations in the southern part of the WSC, what in turn could lead to food web reorganization of important top predators, such as little auks, and induce northward migrations of fish, especially the Norwegian herring.},

	abstract = {Most organisms in temperate or tropic regions employ the light-dark (LD) cycle as the primary Zeitgeber to synchronize circadian rhythms. At higher latitudes ({\textgreater}66°33′), continuous illumination during the summer presents a significant time-keeping dilemma for polar-adapted species. Lapland longspurs (Calcarius lapponicus), arctic-breeding migratory songbirds, are one of the few recorded species maintaining an intact diel rhythm in activity and plasma melatonin titers during polar summer. However, it is unknown whether rhythms are endogenous and entrain to low-amplitude polar Zeitgeber signals, such as daily variations in light intensity and the spectral composition of the sun (as measured by color temperature). Wild-caught male and female longspurs were brought into captivity, and locomotor activity was assessed using infrared detection. To examine if rhythms were endogenous, birds were exposed to constant bright light (LL; 1300 lux) or constant darkness (DD; 0.1 lux). All birds exhibited free-running activity rhythms in LL and DD, suggesting the presence of a functional circadian clock. Mean periods in LL (22.86 h) were significantly shorter than those in DD (23.5 h), in accordance with Aschoff’s rule. No birds entrained to diel changes in light intensity, color temperature, or both. To examine endogenous molecular clock function, the Per2 gene was partially cloned in longspurs (llPer2) and transcripts were measured in hypothalamic tissue punches, eye, and liver using competitive polymerase chain reaction. Ocular llPer2 gene expression was periodic in LL and elevated at ZT24 (CT24) for LD or constant conditions (LL and DD), but llPer2 rhythmicity was not detected in hypothalamus or liver. Plasma melatonin was significantly lower in LL compared with LD or DD. In conclusion, rhythmic ocular Per2 expression and melatonin secretion may maintain the circadian activity rhythm across the polar day.},

These neurons appear to be circadian clock cells, because PER and per mRNA are colocalized and their levels oscillate in these cells, Timeless protein immunoreactivity is coexpressed in each PER-positive neuron, and clock protein and mRNA oscillations are all suppressed in these neurons by constant light. A per antisense RNA oscillation was detected that is spatially restricted to PER-expressing cells, suggesting a novel mechanism of PER regulation. PER-positive neurons and their projections are strategically positioned for regulating prothoracicotropic hormone and eclosion hormone, two neurohormones under circadian control. Differences in the molecular details of PER expression and regulation between the brains of silkmoths and fruitflies provide insights into the mechanisms of clock gene regulation.},

	abstract = {Selective feeding by the calanoid copepod Calanus finmarchicus was investigated during a 3-month study in spring 1997 at a permanent station in the Norwegian Sea (Sta. M, 66°N, 02°E). Phytoplankton biomass increased from 317 ng chlorophyll a (Chl a) liter−1 in the prebloom phase to 2,095 ng liter−1 during the bloom and declined after the bloom to 1,260 ng Chl a liter−1. In the prebloom phase, clearance rates of C. finmarchicus females were between 22 and 100 ml copepod−1 d−1, while during the bloom, they ranged from 75 to 92 ml copepod−1 d−1, with a decline in the postbloom phase (41 ml copepod−1 d−1). After the phytoplankton bloom, the C. finmarchicus population was dominated by copepodid stages CIV and CV, with clearance rates ranging from 7 to 23 ml copepod−1 d−1. Grazing rates of adult females on the phytoplankton standing stock were low in the prebloom phases (5–23 Chl a copepod−1 d−1, respectively), increased during the bloom from 82 to 219 ng Chl a copepod−1 d−1, and declined after the bloom (64 ng Chl a copepod−1 d−1 for adult females and 7–27 ng Chl a copepod−1 d−1 for copepodid stages CIV and CV). C. finmarchicus showed a selection for diatoms throughout the study period and for dinoflagellates, before and after the spring bloom, despite the low concentration of both groups in the pre- and postbloom phases. During the postbloom period, no differences were observed in the selective feeding behavior of the copepodid stages compared to the adults. The contribution of diatoms to the overall phytoplankton biomass was 8 and 14\% in the pre- and postbloom periods, respectively, while dinoflagellates were ≦3\%. Haptophytes (dominated by Phaeocystis pouchetii) and cryptophytes were ingested according to their abundance. Avoidance of cyanobacteria (Synechococcus spp.), pelagophytes, and “green algae” was observed throughout the study period.},

A number of themes emerge: (1) the south-to-north transport of plankton in the northeast Atlantic contrasts with north-to-south transport in the western North Atlantic, which has implications for understanding population responses of C. finmarchicus to climate forcing, (2) recruitment to the youngest copepodite stages occurs during or just after the phytoplankton bloom in the east whereas it occurs after the bloom at many western sites, with up to 3.5months difference in recruitment timing, (3) the deep basin and gyre of the southern Norwegian Sea is the centre of production and overwintering of C. finmarchicus, upon which the surrounding waters depend, whereas, in the Labrador/Irminger Seas production mainly occurs along the margins, such that the deep basins serve as collection areas and refugia for the overwintering populations, rather than as centres of production, (4) the western North Atlantic marginal seas have an important role in sustaining high C. finmarchicus abundance on the nearby coastal shelves, (5) differences in mean temperature and chlorophyll concentration between the western and eastern North Atlantic are reflected in regional differences in female body size and egg production, (6) regional differences in functional responses of egg production rate may reflect genetic differences between western and eastern populations, (7) dormancy duration is generally shorter in the deep waters adjacent to the lower latitude western North Atlantic shelves than in the east, (8) there are differences in stage-specific daily mortality rates between eastern and western shelves and basins, but the survival trajectories for cohort development from CI to CV are similar, and (9) early life stage survival is much lower in regions where C. finmarchicus is found with its congeners, C. glacialis and/or C. hyperboreus. This compilation and analysis provides new knowledge for evaluation and parameterisation of population models of C. finmarchicus and their responses to climate change in the North Atlantic. The strengths and weaknesses of modeling approaches, including a statistical approach based on ecological niche theory and a dynamical approach based on knowledge of spatial population dynamics and life history, are discussed, as well as needs for further research.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial.

	abstract = {The motivation of the LAKRIS project (Lazarev Krill Study) was to investigate the seasonal and interannual variability in distribution, demography, phenology and population dynamics of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba in poorly studied high-latitude areas. The core data set consists of four RMT-net-sampling surveys that were conducted in early summer (December 2005 and 2007), autumn (April 2004) and winter (July to August 2006). Supplementary data were analysed from the 1980s to view the results in a wider geographical context. The major observations are the following: (1) krill abundance and distribution showed geographical, seasonal and interannual fluctuations. Krill abundance was almost one order of magnitude lower compared to the Southwest Atlantic. (2) Krill density showed substantial differences between day and night for autumn and winter surveys. (3) A spatial gradient was observed for krill size groups, with larger sized (adult spawning) krill further south and medium-sized juveniles and immatures mainly between 60° and 67°S. (4) Data on maturity stage composition and larvae occurrence indicate an active and successful spawning in these high-latitude areas even under the conditions of sea-ice cover. At the end of the spawning season, females and males regressed in their external sexual characteristics (‘re-juvenation’) to overwintering immature stages. Major conclusions relate to a conceptual view of the spatial distribution of krill size classes and the occurrence of larvae in the context of major oceanographic features and current systems in the Lazarev Sea and adjacent ocean sectors. The Lazarev Sea obviously does not support a single self-maintaining population, but represents a complex transition zone of stocks with different origins from the Scotia Sea and the Cosmonaut Sea.},

	abstract = {* 1Megaplanktivores such as filter-feeding sharks and baleen whales are at the apex of a short food chain (phytoplankton–zooplankton–vertebrate) and are sensitive indicators of sea-surface plankton availability. Even though they spend the majority of their time below the surface it is still not known how most of these species utilize vertical habitat and adapt to short-term changes in food availability.
* 2A key factor likely to control vertical habitat selection by planktivorous sharks is the diel vertical migration (DVM) of zooplankton; however, no study has determined whether specific ocean-habitat type influences their behavioural strategy. Based on the first high-resolution dive data collected for a plankton-feeding fish species we show that DVM patterns of the basking shark Cetorhinus maximus reflect habitat type and zooplankton behaviour.
* 3In deep, well-stratified waters sharks exhibited normal DVM (dusk ascent–dawn descent) by tracking migrating sound-scattering layers characterized by Calanus and euphausiids. Sharks occupying shallow, inner-shelf areas near thermal fronts conducted reverse DVM (dusk descent–dawn ascent) possibly due to zooplankton predator–prey interactions that resulted in reverse DVM of Calanus.
* 4These opposite DVM patterns resulted in the probability of daytime-surface sighting differing between these habitats by as much as two orders of magnitude. Ship-borne surveys undertaken at the same time as trackings reflected these behavioural differences.
* 5The tendency of basking sharks to feed or rest for long periods at the surface has made them vulnerable to harpoon fisheries. Ship-borne and aerial surveys also use surface occurrence to assess distribution and abundance for conservation purposes. Our study indicates that without bias reduction for habitat-specific DVM patterns, current surveys could under- or overestimate shark abundance by at least 10-fold.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Dosidicus gigas is a large and powerful oceanic squid that is economically valuable and ecologically important in the eastern Pacific Ocean. We employed electronic tagging methods to provide the first long-term monitoring of the natural behaviors of D. gigas in its mesopelagic habitat. Seven pop-up satellite tags logged depth and temperature for a total of 842 h, and a conventional archival tag yielded 780 h of continuous time-series data. Horizontal movements of nearly 100 km over 3 d were observed, and these were temporally associated with an established trans-Gulf migration. Squid consistently spent most daylight hours at depths {\textgreater}250 m, the approximate upper boundary of a midwater hypoxic zone termed the oxygen minimum layer (OML). A diel migration brought squid to near-surface waters at dusk, but a highly variable amount of diving back into the OML occurred throughout the night. Rhythmic vertical movements within the OML often occurred, and sojourns of up to 6 h in this hypoxic zone below 300 m were observed. Laboratory experiments revealed a high resting rate of oxygen consumption under normal conditions, but this rate decreased drastically under hypoxic conditions such as would be associated with the OML in nature. These findings suggest that D. gigas has physiological adaptations that permit constant foraging in both oxygenated near-surface waters and within the OML.},

Examples of migrations in both environments are presented, from which it is concluded that relative changes in light intensity before sunrise and after sunset are primary causes of migrations. Experiments have shown that photoreactive behaviour is enhanced in the presence of predators but inhibited by shortage of food. These factors are called secondary causal factors. A hierarchy of causal factors is proposed. In lakes fish exudates suffice but in marine biotopes like bays, it is possible that fish have to be actually present for enhancement to take effect. To what extent the presented stimulus-response mechanism holds for mesopelagic animals in oceans is discussed on the basis of vertical distributions of euphausiids.},

The duration of foraging trips and contents of gular pouches were analysed. Quantitative zooplankton samples procured in the vicinity of the colony facilitated a comparison between gular pouch contents and the availability of prey species. Zooplankton and gular pouch samples were all sampled within a time window of approximately one week. Using the Bray–Curtis similarity index, we determined that little auks in this colony have a bimodal foraging strategy consisting of long and short foraging trips with two corresponding distinct diets. Short trips are most likely to be centred on areas within the Isfjorden complex, whereas the birds are most likely to use the long trips (of typically more than 10 hours) to reach areas off the continental slope where they are able to feed selectively on large, energy-rich food items such as Calanus hyperboreus. This bimodal foraging strategy may be a response to the low availability of nutrient-rich food close to the colony, which is insufficient to sustain both parents and chicks. Bimodal foraging trip strategies are well documented in many species in the Southern Ocean. This is the first study to show a similar feeding pattern in an Alcidae species in the Northern Hemisphere.},

Although activity and blood-feeding rhythms are controlled by the circadian clock, it is not yet known whether such species-specific differences in behavior are controlled directly by core clock genes or instead reflect differences in how the information of the central clock is translated into output signals. The authors have analyzed the circadian expression of clock genes in two important mosquito vectors of tropical diseases, Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus . Although these two species show very different locomotor activity patterns and are estimated to have diverged more than 22 million years ago, they show conserved circadian expression patterns for all major cycling clock genes except mammalian-like cryptochrome2 (cry2). The results indicate that different mechanisms for cry2 regulation may exist for the two species. The authors speculate that the correlation between the differences in behavior between Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus and their corresponding cry2 mRNA profiles suggests a potential role for this clock gene in controlling species-specific rhythmic behavior. However, further work is needed to establish that this is the case as the different  cry2 expression patterns might reflect differences between the Aedes and Culex lineages that are not directly related to changes in behavior.},

When grown under nutrient-limiting conditions in a chemostat, prototrophic strains of budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, adopt a robust metabolic cycle of ultradian dimensions that temporally compartmentalizes essential cellular events. The CDC is gated by this yeast metabolic cycle (YMC), with DNA replication strictly segregated away from the oxidative phase when cells are actively respiring. Mutants impaired in such gating allow DNA replication to take place during the respiratory phase of the YMC and have been found to suffer significantly elevated rates of spontaneous mutation. Analogous to the circadian cycle, the YMC also employs the conserved DNA checkpoint kinase Rad53/Chk2 to facilitate coupling with the CDC. These studies highlight an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that seems to confine cell division to particular temporal windows to prevent DNA damage. We hypothesize that DNA damage itself might constitute a “zeitgeber”, or time giver, for both the circadian cycle and the metabolic cycle. We discuss these findings in the context of a unifying theme underlying the circadian and metabolic cycles, and explore the relevance of cell cycle gating to human diseases including cancer.},

	abstract = {This article reviews human and animal studies about the circadian patterns of physiological variables involved with the respiratory function. Some measures reflecting the mechanical properties of the lungs, such as functional residual capacity, forced expiratory volumes and airway resistance, change periodically with the time of the day. Also resting pulmonary ventilation (V̇E), tidal volume, and breathing rate follow circadian patterns. In humans, these patterns occur independently of the daily changes in activity, whereas, to some extent, they are linked to changes in the state of arousal. Differently, in some rodents, the circadian oscillations of the breathing pattern occur independently of the daily rhythms of either activity or state of arousal. Recent measurements of the breathing pattern for unlimited periods of time in undisturbed animals have indicated that the circadian changes occur in close temporal phase with those of oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and body temperature. However, none of these variables can fully explain the circadian pattern of breathing, the origin of which remains unclear. Both in humans and in rats the V̇E responses to hypercapnia or hypoxia differ at various times of the day. In rats, the daily differences in V̇E responses are buffered by changes in metabolic rate, such that, unlike humans, the hyperventilation (defined as the increase in ventilation–metabolism ratio) remains constant throughout the 24 h. The presence of a biological clock is a major advantage in the adaptation to the environment, although it forces some variables to deviate periodically from their mean value. In humans, these deviations become apparent in conditions of hypoxia. Hence, a daily time-window exists in which the respiratory system is less capable of responding to challenges, a factor which may contribute to the findings that some cardio-respiratory symptoms and diseases peak at particular times of the day.},

Within the tests there were differences in the eating times of individual rats that were not attributable to the experimental manipulations.

Here the authors propose that circannual rhythm generation depends on tissue-autonomous, reiterated cycles of cell division, functional differentiation, and cell death. They see the feedback control influencing localized stem cell niches as crucial to this cyclical histogenesis hypothesis. Analogous to multi-oscillator circadian organization, circannual rhythm generation occurs in multiple tissues with hypothalamic and pituitary sites serving as central pacemakers. Signals including day length, nutrition, and social factors can synchronize circannual rhythms through hormonal influences, notably via the thyroid and glucocorticoid axes, which have profound effects on histogenesis. The authors offer 4 arguments in support of this hypothesis: (1) Cyclical histogenesis is a prevalent process in seasonal remodeling of physiology. It operates over long time domains and exhibits tissue autonomy in its regulation. (2) Experiments in which selected peripheral endocrine signals are held constant indicate that circannual rhythms are not primarily the product of interacting hormonal feedback loops. (3) Hormones known to control cell proliferation, differentiation, and organogenesis profoundly affect circannual rhythm expression. (4) The convergence point between photoperiodic input pathways and circannual rhythm expression occurs in histogenic regions of the hypothalamus and pituitary. In this review, the authors discuss how testing this hypothesis will depend on the use of cellular/molecular tools and animal models borrowed from developmental biology and neural stem cell research.},

	abstract = {Effects of temperature and temperature changes on circadian clocks in cyanobacteria, unicellular algae, and plants, as well as fungi, arthropods, and vertebrates are reviewed. Periodic temperature with periods around 24 h even in the low range of 1–2°C (strong Zeitgeber effect) can entrain all ectothermic (poikilothermic) organisms. This is also reflected by the phase shifts—recorded by phase response curves (PRCs)—that are elicited by step- or pulsewise changes in the temperature. The amount of phase shift (weak or strong type of PRC) depends on the amplitude of the temperature change and on its duration when applied as a pulse. Form and position of the PRC to temperature pulses are similar to those of the PRC to light pulses. A combined high/low temperature and light/dark cycle leads to a stabile phase and maximal amplitude of the circadian rhythm—when applied in phase (i.e., warm/light and cold/dark). When the two Zeitgeber cycles are phase-shifted against each other the phase of the circadian rhythm is determined by either Zeitgeber or by both, depending on the relative strength (amplitude) of both Zeitgeber signals and the sensitivity of the species/individual toward them. A phase jump of the circadian rhythm has been observed in several organisms at a certain phase relationship of the two Zeitgeber cycles.Ectothermic organisms show inter- and intraspecies plus seasonal variations in the temperature limits for the expression of the clock, either of the basic molecular mechanism, and/or the dependent variables. A step-down from higher temperatures or a step-up from lower temperatures to moderate temperatures often results in initiation of oscillations from phase positions that are about 180° different. This may be explained by holding the clock at different phase positions (maximum or minimum of a clock component) or by significantly different levels of clock components at the higher or lower temperatures. Different permissive temperatures result in different circadian amplitudes, that usually show a species-specific optimum.In endothermic (homeothermic) organisms periodic temperature changes of about 24 h often cause entrainment, although with considerable individual differences, only if they are of rather high amplitudes (weak Zeitgeber effects). The same applies to the phase-shifting effects of temperature pulses. Isolated bird pineals and rat suprachiasmatic nuclei tissues on the other hand, respond to medium high temperature pulses and reveal PRCs similar to that of light signals. Therefore, one may speculate that the self-selected circadian rhythm of body temperature in reptiles or the endogenously controlled body temperature in homeotherms (some of which show temperature differences of more than 2°C) may, in itself, serve as an internal entraining system. The so-called heterothermic mammals (undergoing low body temperature states in a daily or seasonal pattern) may be more sensitive to temperature changes.Effects of temperature elevation on the molecular clock mechanisms have been shown in Neurospora (induction of the frequency (FRQ) protein) and in Drosophila (degradation of the period (PER) and timeless (TIM) protein) and can explain observed phase shifts of rhythms in conidiation and locomotor activity, respectively.Temperature changes probably act directly on all processes of the clock mechanism some being more sensitive than the others. Temperature changes affect membrane properties, ion homeostasis, calcium influx, and other signal cascades (cAMP, cGMP, and the protein kinases A and C) (indirect effects) and may thus influence, in particular, protein phosphorylation processes of the clock mechanism. The temperature effects resemble to some degree those induced by light or by light-transducing neurons and their transmitters. In ectothermic vertebrates temperature changes significantly affect the melatonin rhythm, which in turn exerts entraining (phase shifting) functions.},

We tested the effects that ocean acidification from elevated levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) could have on the ability of larvae to detect olfactory cues from adult habitats. Larval clownfish reared in control seawater (pH 8.15) discriminated between a range of cues that could help them locate reef habitat and suitable settlement sites. This discriminatory ability was disrupted when larvae were reared in conditions simulating CO2-induced ocean acidification. Larvae became strongly attracted to olfactory stimuli they normally avoided when reared at levels of ocean pH that could occur ca. 2100 (pH 7.8) and they no longer responded to any olfactory cues when reared at pH levels (pH 7.6) that might be attained later next century on a business-as-usual carbon-dioxide emissions trajectory. If acidification continues unabated, the impairment of sensory ability will reduce population sustainability of many marine species, with potentially profound consequences for marine diversity.},

Results confirm the existence of a circadian clock in C. gigas. Under entrainment regimes (12-h dark/12-h light photoperiod and tidal cycles simulated by a reversing current flow), oysters exhibited both circadian and circatidal cycles. Under free-running conditions (e.g., continuous darkness), the endogenous rhythm appeared to be circadian. There was no experimental evidence for an endogenous circatidal rhythm, even in oysters just transferred from the field, where a clear tidal cycle was expressed. There are two possible mechanisms to explain tidal behavior in C. gigas: an exogenous tidal cue that drives tidal activity and masks the circadian rhythm and an endogenous circatidal clock that is sensitive to tidal zeitgebers and runs at tidal frequency.},

We characterized environmental conditions [sea depth, sea surface temperature (SST), marginal sea ice zone (MIZ)] at foraging positions of GPS-tracked individuals from three breeding colonies in Svalbard: one located at the southern rim of the Arctic zone (hereafter ‘boreo-Arctic’) and two in the high-Arctic zone on Spitsbergen (‘high-Arctic’). The birds from one ‘high-Arctic’ colony, influenced by cold Arctic water, foraged in the shallow shelf zone near the colony. The birds from remaining colonies foraged in a wider range of depths, in a higher SST zone (‘boreo-Arctic’) or in the productive but distant MIZ (second ‘high-Arctic’ colony). Given this flexible foraging behaviour, little auks may be temporarily resilient to moderate climate changes. However, our fuzzy logic models of future distribution under scenarios of 1 °C and 2 °C SST increase predict losses of suitable foraging habitat for the majority of little auk colonies studied. Over longer time scales negative consequences of global warming are inevitable. The actual response of little auks to future environmental conditions will depend on the range of their plasticity and pace of ecosystem changes.},

	abstract = {The spread of adaptive genetic variants in populations is a cornerstone of evolutionary theory but with relatively few biologically well-understood examples. Previous work on the ls-tim variant of timeless, which encodes the light-sensitive circadian regulator in Drosophila melanogaster, suggests that it may have originated in southeastern Italy. Flies characterized by the new allele show photoperiod-related phenotypes likely to be adaptive in seasonal environments. ls-tim may be spreading from its point of origin in Italy by directional selection, but there are alternative explanations for its observed clinal geographical distribution, including balancing selection and demography. From population analyses of ls-tim frequencies collected on the eastern side of the Iberian Peninsula, we show that ls-tim frequencies are inverted compared with those in Italy. This pattern is consistent with a scenario of directional selection rather than latitude-associated balancing selection. Neutrality tests further reveal the signature of directional selection at the ls-tim site, which is reduced a few kb pairs either side of ls-tim. A reanalysis of allele frequencies from a large number of microsatellite loci do not demonstrate any frequent ls-tim-like spatial patterns, so a general demographic effect or population expansion from southeastern Italy cannot readily explain current ls-tim frequencies. Finally, a revised estimate of the age of ls-tim allele using linkage disequilibrium and coalescent-based approaches reveals that it may be only 300 to 3000 years old, perhaps explaining why it has not yet gone to fixation. ls-tim thus provides a rare temporal snapshot of a new allele that has come under selection before it reaches equilibrium.},

Here, we have for the first time examined an animal's response to a complete life cycle of exposure to co-occurring warming (+3°C) and ocean acidification (+1,600 μatm CO2), using the key subarctic planktonic copepod, Calanus finmarchicus, as a model species. The animals were generally negatively affected by warming, which significantly reduced the females’ energy status and reproductive parameters (respectively, 95\% and 69\%–87\% vs. control). Unexpectedly, simultaneous acidification partially offset the negative effect of warming in an antagonistic manner, significantly improving reproductive parameters and hatching success (233\%–340\% improvement vs. single warming exposure). The results provide proof of concept that ocean acidification may partially offset negative effects caused by warming in some species. Possible explanations and ecological implications for the observed antagonistic effect are discussed.},

It is an important resource for European fisheries and its behavior deeply affects its availability. The current knowledge of Nephrops circadian biology is phenomenological as it is currently the case for almost all crustaceans. In attempt to elucidate the putative molecular mechanisms underlying circadian gene regulation in Nephrops, we used a transcriptomics approach on cDNA extracted from the eyestalk, a structure playing a crucial role in controlling behavior of decapods. We studied 14 male lobsters under 12–12 light-darkness blue light cycle. We used the Hiseq 2000 Illumina platform to sequence two eyestalk libraries (under light and darkness conditions) obtaining about 90 millions 100-bp paired-end reads. Trinity was used for the de novo reconstruction of transcriptomes; the size at which half of all assembled bases reside in contigs (N50) was equal to 1796 (light) and 2055 (darkness). We found a list of candidate clock genes and focused our attention on canonical ones: timeless, period, clock and bmal1. The cloning of assembled fragments validated Trinity outputs. The putative Nephrops clock genes showed high levels of identity (blastx on NCBI) with known crustacean clock gene homologs such as Eurydice pulchra (period: 47\%, timeless: 59\%, bmal1: 79\%) and Macrobrachium rosenbergii (clock: 100\%). We also found a vertebrate-like cryptochrome 2. RT-qPCR showed that only timeless had a robust diel pattern of expression. Our data are in accordance with the current knowledge of the crustacean circadian clock, reinforcing the idea that the molecular clockwork of this group shows some differences with the established model in Drosophila melanogaster.},

The three mammalian PER proteins share several regions of sequence homology, and each contains a protein dimerization PAS domain. mPer3 RNA levels oscillate in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and eyes. In the SCN, mPer3 RNA levels are not acutely altered by light exposure at different times during subjective night. This contrasts with the acute induction by light of mPer1 and mPer2 RNA levels during early and late subjective night. mPer3 is widely expressed in tissues outside of brain. In liver, skeletal muscle, and testis, mPer RNAs exhibit prominent, synchronous circadian oscillations. The results highlight the differential light responses among the three mammalian Per genes in the SCN and raise the possibility of circadian oscillators in mammals outside of brain and retina.},

Shrimp were given dsRNA orally via two methods. In the first method, pellet feed was coated with inactivated bacteria containing overexpressed dsRNA of the WSSV VP28 gene, and in the second method, pellet feed was coated with VP28dsRNA–chitosan complex nanoparticles. The treated shrimp were orally challenged with WSSV by feeding WSSV-infected tissue. The experiment was conducted for 30 days. The dsRNA-treated shrimp challenged with WSSV showed higher survival compared to control shrimp. Sixty-eight percent survival was observed in shrimp fed with feed coated with inactivated bacteria containing dsRNA of the WSSV VP28 gene whereas 37\% survival was observed in shrimp fed with VP28dsRNA–chitosan complex nanoparticle–coated feed. The WSSV caused 100\% mortality in shrimp fed with pellet feed coated with inactivated bacteria with empty LITMUS38i vector. At the end of the experiment, the tissue samples prepared from randomly selected shrimp that survived were analyzed via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis for WSSV. The samples were negative for WSSV. Based on the present data and the advantages of dsRNA, we believe that oral administration of crude extract of bacterially expressed VP28dsRNA is a potential therapeutic agent against WSSV infection of shrimp.},

	abstract = {Background: The biological clock synchronizes the organism with the environment, responding to changes in light and temperature. Drosophila CRYPTOCHROME (CRY), a putative circadian photoreceptor, has previously been reported to interact with the clock protein TIMELESS (TIM) in a light-dependent manner. Although TIM dimerizes with PERIOD (PER), no association between CRY and PER has previously been revealed, and aspects of the light dependence of the TIM/CRY interaction are still unclear. Results: Behavioral analysis of double mutants of per and cry suggested a genetic interaction between the two loci. To investigate whether this was reflected in a physical interaction, we employed a yeast-two-hybrid system that revealed a dimerization between PER and CRY. This was further supported by a coimmunoprecipitation assay in tissue culture cells. We also show that the light-dependent nuclear interactions of PER and TIM with CRY require the C terminus of CRY and may involve a trans-acting repressor. Conclusions: This study shows that, as in mammals, Drosophila CRY interacts with PER, and, as in plants, the C terminus of CRY is involved in mediating light responses. A model for the light dependence of CRY is discussed.},

While gene expression studies have provided new insight into patterns of gene regulation, a lack of reverse genetic tools has so far limited the depth of functional analyses in this species. To address this need, we established customized transcriptional activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) as a tool to engineer targeted modifications in Platynereis genes. By adapting a workflow of TALEN construction protocols and mutation screening approaches for use in Platynereis, we engineered frameshift mutations in three endogenous Platynereis genes. We confirmed that such mutations are heritable, demonstrating that TALENs can be used to generate homozygous knockout lines in P. dumerilii. This is the first use of TALENs for generating genetic knockout mutations in an annelid model. These tools not only open the door for detailed in vivo functional analyses, but also can facilitate further technical development, such as targeted genome editing.},

The influence of each single zeitgeber on the clock has been well studied, but little is known about any synergistic effects of both zeitgebers on the clock. In nature, light and temperature show characteristic daily oscillations with the temperature rising during the light phase and reaching its maximum in the late afternoon. Here, we studied behavioral and molecular rhythms in Drosophila melanogaster under simulated natural low light-dark (LD) and temperature (T) cycles that typically occur during the September equinox. Wild-type flies were either subjected to simulated LD or T cycles alone or to a combination of both. Behavioral rhythms and molecular rhythms in the different clock neurons were assessed under the 3 different conditions. Although behavioral rhythms entrained to all conditions, the rhythms were most robust under the combination of LD and T cycles. The clock neurons responded differently to LD and T cycles. Some were not entrained by T cycles alone; others were only slightly entrained by LD cycles alone. The amplitude of the molecular cycling was not different between LD alone and T cycles alone; but LD alone could set the pacemaker neurons to similar phases, whereas T cycles alone could not. The combination of the 2 zeitgebers entrained all clock neurons not only with similar phase but also enhanced the amplitude of Timeless cycling in the majority of cells. Our results show that the 2 zeitgebers synergistically entrain behavioral and molecular rhythms of Drosophila melanogaster.},

Volumetric respirometers, designed specifically for long-term measurements of oxygen uptake by small fishes under controlled conditions, were used during standard 5 day experiments. Despite some individual variation, certain species-specific and genus-specific patterns of respiration emerged. Each species showed a persistant (advancing) rhythm of oxygen consumption during 3 days of DD. Light appeared to be the “Zeitgeber”, with the light-dark transition phasing the nocturnal peaks and the dark-light transition possibly phasing the diurnal ones. Genus-specific and species-specific trends in field behavior, habitat selection, and distribution were studied. There were correlations between the field behavior and the entrained respiratory rhythms of these nocturnally active fishes. Entrained and endogenous rhythms of each species showed characteristic similarities and were interpreted as integral components of a level of organization evolved for nocturnal life in the shallow marine environment.},

Whole-transcriptome (RNA-seq) analysis of 39 samples collected during austral spring and summer 2011 in the WAP and in summer 2009 in the Indian Sector revealed clustering of samples by regions, seasons, and areas (Bray–Curtis similarity). The highest numbers of differentially expressed genes at the 4×, 20×, and 100× fold-change levels were found between salps collected during spring versus summer 2011 in the WAP (analysis of variance, ANOVA). Spring versus summer samples showed significant differential expression of 77 genes associated with environmental stress response and 51 genes associated with sexual reproduction (paired t tests, p {\textless} 0.05), with significant association between expression of these genes and temperature at the collection site shown by multidimensional scaling analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis identified 41 GO terms responsible for spring versus summer differences, including 156 genes associated with translation (i.e., protein synthesis). The reference transcriptome and characterization of time/space patterns of whole-transcriptome and target gene differential expression provide a foundation for functional analysis and identification of molecular markers of physiological condition, life history events, and responses to climate change in this key species in Antarctic pelagic ecosystems.},

Disruption of the clock leads to metabolic disorders, including obesity and diabetes. As food is a potent zeitgeber (ZT) for peripheral clocks, metabolites are implicated as cellular transducers of circadian time for tissues such as the liver. From a comprehensive dataset of over 500 metabolites identified by mass spectrometry, we reveal the coordinate clock-controlled oscillation of many metabolites, including those within the amino acid and carbohydrate metabolic pathways as well as the lipid, nucleotide, and xenobiotic metabolic pathways. Using computational modeling, we present evidence of synergistic nodes between the circadian transcriptome and specific metabolic pathways. Validation of these nodes reveals that diverse metabolic pathways, including the uracil salvage pathway, oscillate in a circadian fashion and in a CLOCK-dependent manner. This integrated map illustrates the coherence within the circadian metabolome, transcriptome, and proteome and how these are connected through specific nodes that operate in concert to achieve metabolic homeostasis.},

	abstract = {A rise in global temperatures could potentially lead to less ice in the Arctic, including a reduction in the ice-covered period. The consequence of a changing ice cover on the food web structure and production in Disko Bay, Western Greenland, is analysed through application of a dynamical model for the planktonic food web. The model is successfully calibrated and tested for sensitivity, using a detailed data set for 1996–1997. Model scenarios are (1) extended ice cover and (2) no ice. These scenarios are compared to model runs with measured ice cover in two normal years. In the extended ice scenario, assuming unchanged copepod behaviour, copepods are starving or feeding in the ice/water interface from the time they ascend to the surface layer from over-wintering depths until the ice break-up in June. The total annual primary production reaches the same level as it does in the average year, but copepod ingestion and, as a consequence, vertical carbon export is reduced by app. 40\%. In the ice-free situation, an early diatom bloom is initiated by stratification of the water in March, before the copepods ascend. The diatom bloom is grazed upon by protozooplankton, which reach a high biomass before the copepods ascend in April. Annual primary production increases by 52\% while copepod ingestion and vertical loss of carbon is reduced by 57\%. This study illustrates how a change in the ice cover in Arctic areas can potentially create a mismatch between spring primary production and copepod grazers. The result may be a planktonic food web dominated by protozooplankton, resulting in lower export of organic material out of the photic zone despite increased primary productivity, or alternatively lead to changes in species composition or behaviour.},

	abstract = {The sequence of extreme September sea ice extent minima over the past decade suggests acceleration in the response of the Arctic sea ice cover to external forcing, hastening the ongoing transition towards a seasonally open Arctic Ocean. This reflects several mutually supporting processes. Because of the extensive open water in recent Septembers, ice cover in the following spring is increasingly dominated by thin, first-year ice (ice formed during the previous autumn and winter) that is vulnerable to melting out in summer. Thinner ice in spring in turn fosters a stronger summer ice-albedo feedback through earlier formation of open water areas. A thin ice cover is also more vulnerable to strong summer retreat under anomalous atmospheric forcing. Finally, general warming of the Arctic has reduced the likelihood of cold years that could bring about temporary recovery of the ice cover. Events leading to the September ice extent minima of recent years exemplify these processes.},

	abstract = {Seasonal dynamics of feeding activity, oil sac volume, gonad development, sex ratio and spawning periods in the two sibling species Calanusfinmarchicus and C. hyperboreus, the key zooplankton copepod organisms throughout the northern Atlantic waters, were studied simultaneously in Malangen, northern Norway, during 1992. We were also tracing differences in surface- and deep-dwelling components of these populations in terms of oil sac volume and gonad development during the time period when the G1 is preparing for a subsequent generation (G2) or hibernation. The main difference in the life cycle strategies of these species is the earlier maturation and spawning of C. hyperboreus. No feeding activity in either of the two species was found in February, but both commenced feeding in March, prior to the spring phytoplankton peak. The larger copepod, C. hyperboreus, had a more intensive energy deposition than C. finmarchicus. The period of active feeding was much shorter for the former species, only from March through July in copepodite stages CIV and CV, and even less in females – March and April. Basically, a similar pattern of seasonal changes in gonad length and lipids was observed in the two species. In June, oil sacs in the surface- and deep-dwelling specimens were about equal, during the rest of the year, lipids in the deep CVs exceeded those in the surface. We propose that as copepods accumulated sufficient lipid reserves, they started to descend, while others, containing less fat, stayed in the upper layers feeding. The mean length of the gonads in the surface-dwelling copepods was consistently less than in their deep counterparts from October to February, so that gonad development at the expense of accumulated reserves during resting stage was confirmed. C. finmarchicus males were found in considerable numbers only in February and March, and were only occasionally found in the upper layers (0–100 m), while adult male C. hyperboreus were present from October to March, but were never found in the surface layers. The differences in life cycle timing among the two species are discussed in relation to tradeoffs with regard to foraging strategies, generation numbers, bioenergetics and predator avoidance.},

The Arctic shelf species, C. glacialis, dominated the zooplankton assemblage of many Norwegian fjords, where only C. finmarchicus has been reported previously. In these fjords, high occurrences of the Arctic species C. hyperboreus were also found. Molecular markers revealed that the most common method of species identification, prosome length, cannot reliably discriminate the species in Norwegian fjords. Differences in degree of genetic differentiation among fjord populations of the two species suggested that C. glacialis is a more permanent resident of the fjords than C. finmarchicus. We found no evidence of hybridization between the species. Our results indicate a critical need for the wider use of molecular markers to reliably identify and discriminate these morphologically similar copepod species, which serve as important indicators of climate responses.},

Furthermore, we detected an antiphasic relationship in the circadian rhythms of mating activity between D. melanogaster and its sibling species Drosophila simulans.

	abstract = {Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a key species in Southern Ocean ecosystem where it plays a central role in the Antarctic food web. Available information supports the existence of an endogenous timing system in krill enabling it to synchronize metabolism and behavior with an environment characterized by extreme seasonal changes in terms of day length, food availability, and surface ice extent. A screening of our transcriptome database “KrillDB” allowed us to identify the putative orthologues of 20 circadian clock components. Mapping of conserved domains and phylogenetic analyses strongly supported annotations of the identified sequences. Luciferase assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments allowed us to define the role of the main clock components. Our findings provide an overall picture of the molecular mechanisms underlying the functioning of the endogenous circadian clock in the Antarctic krill and shed light on their evolution throughout crustaceans speciation. Interestingly, the core clock machinery shows both mammalian and insect features that presumably contribute to an evolutionary strategy to cope with polar environment’s challenges. Moreover, despite the extreme variability characterizing the Antarctic seasonal day length, the conserved light mediated degradation of the photoreceptor EsCRY1 suggests a persisting pivotal role of light as a Zeitgeber.},

A population of the cold-water species, Calanus finmarchicus, was collected in March 2004 and maintained in a static system of 100 l polypropylene containers through all stages (Eggs–CVI). The population exhibited an average developmental time of 105 days which corresponds to realistic sub-Arctic to Arctic conditions (water temperatures=5 °C (spring) and 8 °C (late summer)). A series of experiments was performed to examine copepod egg production as a function of different food sources and feeding concentrations. Only minor differences in egg production were observed for C. finmarchicus females fed with varying concentrations of the two diatom species Chaetoceros socialis and Thalassiosira weissflogii. In a separate experiment, the response to food availability was examined over time by tracking egg production and fecal pellet production (used as an indicator of food ingestion). Both hatching success and food ingestion were positively correlated with the food concentrations offered to adult females. Through this work we have demonstrated that C. finmarchicus populations can be maintained in the laboratory through multiple generations. In addition, methods to control egg production through changes in food availability have been established making it feasible to control the start date of exposure experiments or the timing of the collection of eggs to initiate a new generation.},

	abstract = {Despite diel and seasonal vertical migrations (DVM and SVM) of high-latitude zooplankton have been studied since the late-19th century, questions still remain about the influence of environmental seasonality on vertical migration, and the combined influence of DVM and SVM on zooplankton fitness. Toward addressing these, we developed a model for simulating DVM and SVM of high-latitude herbivorous copepods in high spatio-temporal resolution. In the model, a unique timing and amplitude of DVM and SVM and its ontogenetic trajectory were defined as a vertical strategy. Growth, survival and reproductive performances of numerous vertical strategies hardwired to copepods spawned in different times of the year were assessed by a fitness estimate, which was heuristically maximized by a Genetic Algorithm to derive the optimal vertical strategy for a given model environment. The modelled food concentration, temperature and visual predation risk had a significant influence on the observed vertical strategies. Under low visual predation risk, DVM was less pronounced, and SVM and reproduction occurred earlier in the season, where capital breeding played a significant role. Reproduction was delayed by higher visual predation risk, and copepods that spawned later in the season used the higher food concentrations and temperatures to attain higher growth, which was efficiently traded off for survival through DVM. Consequently, the timing of SVM did not change much from that predicted under lower visual predation risk, but the body and reserve sizes of overwintering stages and the importance of capital breeding diminished. Altogether, these findings emphasize the significance of DVM in environments with elevated visual predation risk and shows its contrasting influence on the phenology of reproduction and SVM, and moreover highlights the importance of conducting field and modeling work to study these migratory strategies in concert.},

	abstract = {Life on earth is shaped by the 24-h rotation of our planet around its axes. To adapt behavior and physiology to the concurring profound but highly predictable changes, endogenous circadian clocks have evolved that drive 24-h rhythms in invertebrate and vertebrate species. At the molecular level, circadian clocks comprised a set of clock genes organized in a system of interlocked transcriptional–translational feedback loops. A ubiquitous network of cellular central and peripheral tissue clocks coordinates physiological functions along the day through activation of tissue-specific transcriptional programs. Circadian rhythms impact on diverse physiological processes including the cardiovascular system, energy metabolism, immunity, hormone secretion, and reproduction. This review summarizes our current understanding of the mechanisms of circadian timekeeping in different species, its adaptation by external timing signals and the pathophysiological consequences of circadian disruption.},

Here, we describe its spectacular reproduction and development and address a number of open research problems. Oogenesis is easily studied because the oocytes grow while floating in the coelom. Unlike the embryos of other model spiralians, the Platynereis embryo is transparent giving insight into the dynamic structures and processes inside the cells that accompany the prevailing anisotropic cleavages. Functional studies on cell specification and differential gene expression in embryos, larvae, and later stages are underway. Lifelong proliferation of uniform trunk segments qualifies Platynereis as a model for the study of gene expression and of the functional circuitry of this process. Platynereis can also become a stepping stone in the comparison of segmentation between annelids and arthropods because it comes closer to the putative ancestral morphology and style of development than other model annelids.

Photoperiodic sensing in photosynthetic organisms is ancient and two major stages in its evolution could be identified, the cyanobacterial time sensing and the evolutionary tool kit that arose in green algae and developed into the photoperiodic system of modern plants.

A typical sequence for a plant cryptochrome was not found in our analysis of the Phaeodactylum tricornutum genome, but one protein grouped with higher plant and green algal cryptochromes. This protein, CryP, binds FAD and 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate, according to our spectroscopic studies on heterologously expressed protein. 5,10-Methenyltetrahydrofolate binding is a feature common to both cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyases and DASH cryptochromes. In recombinant CryP, however, the FAD chromophore was present in its neutral radical state and had a red-shifted absorption maximum at 637 nm, which is more characteristic for a DASH cryptochrome than a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyase. Upon illumination with blue light, the fully reduced state of FAD was formed in the presence of reductant. Expression of CryP was silenced by antisense approaches, and the resulting cell lines showed increased levels of proteins of light-harvesting complexes, the Lhcf proteins, in vivo. In contrast, the levels of proteins active in light protection, the Lhcx proteins, were reduced. Thus, CryP cannot be directly grouped with known members of the cryptochrome/photolyase family. Of all P. tricornutum proteins, it is the most similar in sequence to a plant cryptochrome, and is involved in the regulation of light-harvesting protein expression, but shows spectroscopic features and a chromophore composition that are most typical of a DASH cryptochrome.},

	abstract = {Hulless barley (Hordeum vulgare L. var. nudum. hook. f.) has been cultivated as a major crop in the Qinghai-Tibet plateau of China for thousands of years. Compared to other cereal crops, the Tibetan hulless barley has developed stronger endogenous resistances to survive in the severe environment of its habitat. To understand the unique resistant mechanisms of this plant, detailed genetic studies need to be performed. The quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is the most commonly used method in detecting gene expression. However, the selection of stable reference genes under limited experimental conditions was considered to be an essential step for obtaining accurate results in qRT-PCR. In this study, 10 candidate reference genes—ACT (Actin), E2 (Ubiquitin conjugating enzyme 2), TUBα (Alpha-tubulin), TUBβ6 (Beta-tubulin 6), GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase), EF-1α (Elongation factor 1-alpha), SAMDC (S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase), PKABA1 (Gene for protein kinase HvPKABA1), PGK (Phosphoglycerate kinase), and HSP90 (Heat shock protein 90)—were selected from the NCBI gene database of barley. Following qRT-PCR amplifications of all candidate reference genes in Tibetan hulless barley seedlings under various stressed conditions, the stabilities of these candidates were analyzed by three individual software packages including geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper. The results demonstrated that TUBβ6, E2, TUBα, and HSP90 were generally the most suitable sets under all tested conditions; similarly, TUBα and HSP90 showed peak stability under salt stress, TUBα and EF-1α were the most suitable reference genes under cold stress, and ACT and E2 were the most stable under drought stress. Finally, a known circadian gene CCA1 was used to verify the service ability of chosen reference genes. The results confirmed that all recommended reference genes by the three software were suitable for gene expression analysis under tested stress conditions by the qRT-PCR method.},

	abstract = {Light is a major cue for nearly all life on Earth. However, most of our knowledge concerning the importance of light is based on organisms’ response to light during daytime, including the dusk and dawn phase. When it is dark, light is most often considered as pollution, with increasing appreciation of its negative ecological effects. Using an Autonomous Surface Vehicle fitted with a hyperspectral irradiance sensor and an acoustic profiler, we detected and quantified the behavior of zooplankton in an unpolluted light environment in the high Arctic polar night and compared the results with that from a light-polluted environment close to our research vessels. First, in environments free of light pollution, the zooplankton community is intimately connected to the ambient light regime and performs synchronized diel vertical migrations in the upper 30 m despite the sun never rising above the horizon. Second, the vast majority of the pelagic community exhibits a strong light-escape response in the presence of artificial light, observed down to 100 m. We conclude that artificial light from traditional sampling platforms affects the zooplankton community to a degree where it is impossible to examine its abundance and natural rhythms within the upper 100 m. This study underscores the need to adjust sampling platforms, particularly in dim-light conditions, to capture relevant physical and biological data for ecological studies. It also highlights a previously unchartered susceptibility to light pollution in a region destined to see significant changes in light climate due to a reduced ice cover and an increased anthropogenic activity.
Using new enabling technologies, we document behavioral patterns and susceptibility to light pollution never previously seen.

	abstract = {Ciliary and rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells represent two main lines of photoreceptor evolution in animals. The two photoreceptor-cell types coexist in some animals, however how they functionally integrate is unknown. We used connectomics to map synaptic paths between ciliary and rhabdomeric photoreceptors in the planktonic larva of the annelid Platynereis and found that ciliary photoreceptors are presynaptic to the rhabdomeric circuit. The behaviors mediated by the ciliary and rhabdomeric cells also interact hierarchically. The ciliary photoreceptors are UV-sensitive and mediate downward swimming to non-directional UV light, a behavior absent in ciliary-opsin knockouts. UV avoidance antagonizes positive phototaxis mediated by the rhabdomeric eyes so that vertical swimming direction is determined by the ratio of blue/UV light. Since this ratio increases with depth, Platynereis larvae may use it as a depth gauge during planktonic migration. Our results revealed a functional integration of ciliary and rhabdomeric photoreceptors with implications for eye and photoreceptor evolution.},

	abstract = {Under standard laboratory conditions of rectangular light/dark cycles and constant warm temperature, Drosophila melanogaster show bursts of morning (M) and evening (E) locomotor activity and a “siesta” in the middle of the day. These M and E components have been critical for developing the neuronal dual oscillator model in which clock gene expression in key cells generates the circadian phenotype. However, under natural European summer conditions of cycling temperature and light intensity, an additional prominent afternoon (A) component that replaces the siesta is observed. This component has been described as an “artifact” of the TriKinetics locomotor monitoring system that is used by many circadian laboratories world wide. Using video recordings, we show that the A component is not an artifact, neither in the glass tubes used in TriKinetics monitors nor in open-field arenas. By studying various mutants in the visual and peripheral and internal thermo-sensitive pathways, we reveal that the M component is predominantly dependent on visual input, whereas the A component requires the internal thermo-sensitive channel transient receptor potential A1 (TrpA1). Knockdown of TrpA1 in different neuronal groups reveals that the reported expression of TrpA1 in clock neurons is unlikely to be involved in generating the summer locomotor profile, suggesting that other TrpA1 neurons are responsible for the A component. Studies of circadian rhythms under seminatural conditions therefore provide additional insights into the molecular basis of circadian entrainment that would otherwise be lost under the usual standard laboratory protocols.},

The rhodopsin undergoes unusual pH-dependent spectral changes: above neutrality, the absorbance decreases progressively at 485 nm and rises near 370 nm. This change is reversible and appears to reflect an equilibrium between a protonated and an unprotonated form of the rhodopsin Schiff-base linkage. Near neutral pH and at 10 degrees C, the rhodopsin is partiaLly converted by 420-nm light to a stable 493-nm metarhodopsin. The metarhodopsin is partially photoconverted to rhodopsin by long-wavelength light in the absence of NH2OH; in the presence of NH2OH, it is slowly converted to retinal oxime and opsin. The rhodopsin of Meganyctiphanes norvegica measured in fresh rhabdoms by microspectrophotometry has properties very similar to those of the extracted rhodopsin of E. superba. Its lambda max is 488 nm and it is partially photoconverted by short wavelength irradiation to a stable photoconvertible metarhodopsin similar to that of E. superba. In the presence of light and NH2OH, the M. norvegica metarhodopsin is converted to retinal oxime and opsin. Our results indicate that previous determinations of euphausiid rhodopsin absorbance spectra were incorrect because of accessory pigment contamination.},

In both summer and autumn we identified three geographically coherent subpopulations, which were considered to be either a mating swarm or physical aggregation. Many aggregate forms with an empty (dead) embryo were observed, and the ratio of newborn solitary forms decreased in autumn, indicating sexual reproduction of the salps was deactivated. The significant reduction in size of mature solitaries suggested that the capacity of asexual reproduction was also reduced in autumn. In addition to water temperature decline, the phytoplankton shortage (which was partly caused by high grazing pressure of S. thompsoni during summer) might be the factor causing decline in their own population size in autumn.},

	abstract = {Recent observations have shown that fluxes of ballast minerals (calcium carbonate, opal, and lithogenic material) and organic carbon fluxes are closely correlated in the bathypelagic zones of the ocean. Hence it has been hypothesized that incorporation of biogenic minerals within marine aggregates could either protect the organic matter from decomposition and/or increase the sinking velocity via ballasting of the aggregates. Here we present the first combined data on size, sinking velocity, carbon-specific respiration rate, and composition measured directly in three aggregate types; Emiliania huxleyi aggregates (carbonate ballasted), Skeletonema costatum aggregates (opal ballasted), and aggregates made from a mix of both E. huxleyi and S. costatum (carbonate and opal ballasted). Overall average carbon-specific respiration rate was {\textasciitilde}0.13 d−1 and did not vary with aggregate type and size. Ballasting from carbonate resulted in 2- to 2.5-fold higher sinking velocities than those of aggregates ballasted by opal. We compiled literature data on carbon-specific respiration rate and sinking velocity measured in aggregates of different composition and sources. Compiled carbon-specific respiration rates (including this study) vary between 0.08 d−1 and 0.20 d−1. Sinking velocity increases with increasing aggregate size within homogeneous sources of aggregates. When compared across different particle and aggregate sources, however, sinking velocity appeared to be independent of particle or aggregate size. The carbon-specific respiration rate per meter settled varied between 0.0002 m−1 and 0.0030 m−1, and decreased with increasing aggregate size. It was lower for calcite ballasted aggregates as compared to that of similar sized opal ballasted aggregates.},

Of its ash-free dry weight about 13.6\% is carbon and 3.1\% is nitrogen. All weight parameters were related to body length by a power function of ∼2.3. S. thompsoni was a dominant member of the zooplankton community in waters near the Antarctic Peninsula in the austral summer of 1983–1984, with biomass in mid-March ranging from 49 to 671 mgCm−2 and 9.6 to 146 mgNm−2. Three subpopulations occurred in separate regions: (1) the Bransfield Strait, (2) north of the South Shetland Islands, and (3) west of Elephant Island; these were dominated by 20, 30 and 40 mm individuals, respectively. Biomass was greatest in the Bransfield Strait and least near the South Shetland Islands. Clearance rate measurements of S. thompsoni on naturally occurring particulate matter were significantly lower than those previously reported for mid-latitude salps, a result which we attribute primarily to the effect of low habitat temperature (ca. 1°C). Direct measurements suggest that fecal production by 21 mm blastozoids is equivalent to 10.2\% body carbon d−1 and 6.6\% body nitrogen d−1. Grazing by S. thompsoni may have removed a majority of the daily primary production in March, but {\textless}1\% in January. The comparatively low biomass of krill larvae in 1983–1984 may be attributed partially to competitive removal of food by salps, but an equally important effect may have been direct predation.},

The uptake and depuration kinetics of ingested microplastics for many marine species still remain unknown despite its importance for understanding bioaccumulation potential to higher trophic level consumers. In this study, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) were exposed to polyethylene microplastics in order to quantify acute toxicity and ingestion kinetics, providing insight into the bioaccumulation potential of microplastics at the first-order consumer level. In the 10 day acute toxicity assay, no mortality or dose dependant weight loss occurred in exposed krill, at any of the exposure concentrations (0, 10, 20, 40, or 80 \% plastic diet). Krill exposed to a 20\% plastic diet for 24 hours displayed fast uptake (22 ng mg-1 h-1) and depuration (0.22 h-1) rates, but plastic uptake did not reach steady state. Efficient elimination also resulted in no bioaccumulation over an extended 25 day assay, with most individuals completely eliminating their microplastic burden in less than 5 days post exposure. Our results support recent findings of limited acute toxicity of ingested microplastics at this trophic level, and suggest sublethal chronic endpoints should be the focus of further ecotoxicological investigation.},

	abstract = {The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster survives thermally stressful conditions in a state of reproductive dormancy (diapause), manifested by reduced metabolic activity and arrested ovarian development in females. Unlike insects that rely primarily on photoperiodic stimuli to initiate the diapause program, in this species dormancy is regulated by low temperature and enhanced by shorter photoperiods. Overwintering phenotypes are usually studied under simple laboratory conditions, where animals are exposed to rectangular light-dark (LD) cycles at a constant temperature. We sought to adopt more realistic diapause protocols by generating LD profiles that better mimic outdoor conditions. Experimental flies were subjected to semi-natural late autumn and summer days, while control females received the same amounts of light but in rectangular LD cycles (LD 8:16 and LD 15:9, respectively). We observed that semi-natural autumnal days induced a higher proportion of females to enter dormancy, while females in semi-natural summer days showed reduced diapause compared with their corresponding rectangular controls, generating an impressive photoperiodic response. In contrast, under rectangular light regimes, the diapause of Drosophila field lines exhibited minimal photoperiodicity. Our semi-natural method reveals that D. melanogaster diapause is considerably more photoperiodic than previously believed and suggests that this seasonal response is best studied under simulated natural lighting conditions.},

	abstract = {Mammalian physiology exhibits 24-hour cyclicity due to circadian rhythms of gene expression controlled by transcription factors (TF) that comprise molecular clocks. Core clock TFs bind to the genome at enhancer sequences to regulate circadian gene expression, but not all binding sites are equally functional. Here we demonstrate that circadian gene expression in mouse liver is controlled by rhythmic chromatin interactions between enhancers and promoters. Rev-erbα, a core repressive TF of the clock, opposes functional loop formation between Rev-erbα-regulated enhancers and circadian target gene promoters by recruitment of the NCoR-HDAC3 corepressor complex, histone deacetylation, and eviction of the elongation factor BRD4 and the looping factor MED1. Thus, a repressive arm of the molecular clock operates by rhythmically modulating chromatin loops to control circadian gene transcription.},

Yet, the distribution of fish may also be governed by less acknowledged mechanisms. Ice limits access to air for physostomous fish filling their swimbladders at the surface. We hypothesize that release of ice constraints may facilitate northward expansion of physostomes, with implied impact on their zooplankton prey. On the other hand, even in a changing Arctic, the extreme high-latitude photoperiod will persist. The abundance of mesopelagic fish is low in the Arctic Ocean. Feeding conditions may be inferior during the darkness of winter and in light summer nights. If the photoperiod is constraining distributions, biogeographic boundaries of mesopelagic fish may be relatively unaffected by climate change. Alternatively, if low temperatures are their main constraint, we hypothesize that northward extensions in a warmer ocean may be detrimental to key Arctic copepods as we argue that their current success relates to low mortality during overwintering in the absence of mesopelagic fish. It is therefore essential to discriminate the role of the light climate at high latitudes from those related to temperatures for assessing future biogeographic boundaries.},

	abstract = {Scenarios for climate change predict that global warming drives biogeographic boundaries polewards. However, reliable predictions of marine food web responses to climate change require understanding of the coupling mechanisms between trophic levels. The Arctic is characterized by extreme light regime (photoperiod) as well as extreme (low) temperatures, both with profound bearing on pelagic ecology but only temperature being affected by climate change. Here, I address the potential impact by the light climate on mesopelagic (mid-water) planktivorous fish and as a result their plankton prey. Mesopelagic fish abound in all oceans, except for the Arctic. I hypothesize that their lack of success in this environment is due to inferior feeding conditions imposed by the extreme light climate at high latitudes. Since photoperiod is unaffected by climate change mesopelagic fish may continue to be scarce, and large copepods such as Arctic Calanus spp. will continue to prevail even in a warmer climate. This hypothesis of photoperiod constraints on the effect of global warming in Arctic marine ecosystems may be tested in fjords with different temperatures and light conditions.},

Crustaceans possess an open circulatory system, where nutrients, oxygen, hormones, and cells are distributed in the hemolymph. They lack adaptive immune system and rely exclusively on their innate immune mechanisms that include both cellular and humoral responses. Antimicrobial peptides and proteins form an important means of host defense in eukaryotes. In addition to their role as endogenous antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides have functions in inflammation, wound repair and regulation of the adaptive immune system. Over the past several years, many antimicrobial peptides have been found and characterized in crabs.},

It also supports the notion that factors normally involved in control of female reproduction are associated with immunity in organisms that rely on Vg for oocyte development.},

Ages two through five years were validated, and these animals ranged from 37.1 to 62.6 mm in total length. The band counts in these individuals were either identical to their absolute ages, or only failed to agree by a few months, which demonstrates the accuracy of this method. Precision and bias were estimated graphically using Chang’s index (Coefficient of Variation = 5.03\%). High accuracy and precision between readers and low ageing bias indicate that longitudinal sections of eyestalks can be used to age krill in wild samples and to develop age-based stock assessment models for krill. Archival samples preserved in formalin (5\%) and stored in ambient conditions were also readable. Ageing preserved krill will provide the opportunity to examine changes in growth among krill populations within the Southern Ocean and to retrospectively examine changes in krill production over the last century to better understand the historical and future impacts of climate change on this critical Southern Ocean species.},

	abstract = {Reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a powerful technique to quantify gene expression. To facilitate gene expression study and obtain accurate results, normalization relative to stably expressed reference genes is crucial. The monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus (L.), is one of the most recognized insect species for its spectacular annual migration across North America. Besides its great voyages, D. plexippus has drawn attention to its role as a bio-indicator, ranging from genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to natural ecosystems. In this study, nine reference genes from D. plexippus genome were selected as the candidate reference genes. The expression profiles of these candidates under various biotic and abiotic conditions were evaluated using the four readily available computational programs, BestKeeper, Normfinder, geNorm, and ΔCt method, respectively. Moreover, RefFinder, a web-based computational platform integrating the four above mentioned algorisms, provided a comprehensive ranking of the stability of these reference genes. As a result, a suite of reference genes were recommended for each experimental condition. Specifically, elongation factor 1α (EF1A) and ribosomal protein 49 (RP49) were the most stable reference genes, respectively, under biotic (development, tissue, and sex) and abiotic (photoperiod, temperature, and dietary RNAi) conditions. With the recent release of a 273-million base pair draft genome, results from this study allow us to establish a standardized RT-qPCR analysis and lay a foundation for the subsequent genomic and functional genomic research in D. plexippus, a major bio-indicator and an emerging model for migratory animals.},

Suitable reference genes in B. odoriphaga (Bradysia odoriphaga) have yet to be identified for normalizing target gene expression among samples by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). This study was focused on identifying the expression stability of 12 candidate housekeeping genes in B. odoriphaga under various experiment conditions. The final stability ranking of 12 housekeeping genes was obtained with RefFinder, and the most suitable number of reference genes was analyzed by GeNorm. The results revealed that the most appropriate sets of internal controls were RPS15, RPL18, and RPS18 across developmental phases; RPS15, RPL28, and GAPDH across temperatures; RPS15 and RPL18 across pesticide treatments; RSP5, RPS18, and SDHA across photoperiods; ACTb, RPS18, and RPS15 across diets; RPS13 and RPL28 across populations; and RPS15, ACTb, and RPS18 across all samples. The use of the most suitable reference genes versus an arbitrarily selected reference gene resulted in significant differences in the analysis of a target gene expression. HSP23 in B. odoriphaga was found to be up-regulated under low temperatures. These results will contribute to the standardization of qRT-PCR and will also be valuable for further research on gene function in B. odoriphaga.},

Individual krill respond to a changing landscape of predation risk and food availability by migrating vertically in the water column and choosing an average distance to their nearest neighbor (swarm density). We determine the optimal behavior of 30, 40 and 50 mm krill using a state-dependent life history model where individuals move along 30-day segments of hypothetical journey tracks in three different regions of the Scotia Sea, with the tracks extracted from a combination of circulation models and surface drifter data. Food availability is based on satellite data for surface Chl a with additional heterotrophic and detritus food components, and mortality is parameterized with respect to distance from shore, daylight and krill swarming-behavior. We predict that proximity to predator colonies has a distinct effect on behavior, particularly on depth choice when food-availability is low. Observations made during an acoustic survey of the region found swarms to be deeper at the Antarctic Peninsula compared with South Georgia, in line with model predictions. Our predictions are also consistent with observations that swarm density changes little on a logarithmic scale across the region. We show that being able to change behavior on short time scales has distinct advantages to krill.},

	abstract = {Oxygen consumption rate was measured as a function of swimming velocity for the vertically migrating euphausiid Euphausia pacifica at two temperatures (8° and 12°C) and pressures (1 and 40 atm) typical of its bathymetric distribution. Increased swimming speed (x; mh-1) required increased oxygen consumption (y; μl O2 mg dry weight-1 h-1), described by the equation y = 0.012x + 0.64 at 8°C, and by y = 0.020x + 0.85 at 12° C. The current concept of low swimming costs of zooplankton, based on determinations of dead drag in copepods, is contradicted by our measurements. Temperature had a more profound effect on metabolism at higher swimming speeds (112 m h-1; Q10=2.8) than on standard metabolism (O m h-1; Q10=2.0), indicating that activity is more costly at higher temperatures. Pressure caused a small but significant (P{\textgreater}0.05) rise in the relationship of respiratory rate to swimming speed at both temperatures. The energy cost of vertical migration for E. pacifica was estimated by applying our data on oxygen consumption vs swimming speed to published observations on sonic scattering layer movement and the day-night distribution pattern of this species. Results indicate that the cost of a diel migration of 254 m, through a temperature change of 4 °C (8° to 12° C), would cancel any energetic benefit gained by time spent at the lower temperature typical of daytime depth. The act of vertical migration is energetically expensive; its cost should be thoroughly considered in attempts to describe the energetics of vertically migrating species.},

	abstract = {Summary.? Recent work by Reiss and Ogden provides a theoretical basis for sometimes preferring restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to generalized cross?validation (GCV) for smoothing parameter selection in semiparametric regression. However, existing REML or marginal likelihood (ML) based methods for semiparametric generalized linear models (GLMs) use iterative REML or ML estimation of the smoothing parameters of working linear approximations to the GLM. Such indirect schemes need not converge and fail to do so in a non?negligible proportion of practical analyses. By contrast, very reliable prediction error criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are available, based on direct optimization of GCV, or related criteria, for the GLM itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly defined functions of the smoothing parameters, they have much more reliable convergence properties. The paper develops the first such method for REML or ML estimation of smoothing parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an approximate REML or ML for any GLM, which is suitable for efficient direct optimization. This REML or ML criterion requires that Newton?Raphson iteration, rather than Fisher scoring, be used for GLM fitting, and a computationally stable approach to this is proposed. The REML or ML criterion itself is optimized by a Newton method, with the derivatives required obtained by a mixture of implicit differentiation and direct methods. The method will cope with numerical rank deficiency in the fitted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for prediction error criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation results suggest that the new REML and ML methods offer some improvement in mean?square error performance relative to GCV or Akaike's information criterion in most cases, without the small number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike's information criterion and GCV are prone. This is achieved at the same computational cost as GCV or Akaike's information criterion. The new approach also eliminates the convergence failures of previous REML? or ML?based approaches for penalized GLMs and usually has lower computational cost than these alternatives. Example applications are presented in adaptive smoothing, scalar on function regression and generalized additive model selection.},

Quantitative aspects of distribution, biomass and demography were becoming more important since the late 1970s when a rapidly developing krill fishery started to exploit this unique resource. Since then, opinions have sometimes changed even on the appraisal of basic features such as small and large scale distribution or dispersion as well as on seasonal and interannual changes in biomass. Finally, the stability and size of the entire population had to be revised, which was believed to be relatively stable in a stable environment. Recent work has shown that the krill stocks are undergoing long-term changes and proximate and ultimate causes are still under discussion. Hence, it seems timely to review the current status of the discussion of sometime diverging interpretation of the results on krill distribution and stock dynamics for various spatial and temporal scales.},

One is diurnal and the other is relatively nocturnal. In the first experiment, the authors found that these patterns are strongly influenced by parentage and by sex. Specifically, offspring of two nocturnal parents were significantly more likely to express a nocturnal pattern of wheel-running than were offspring of diurnal parents, and more females than males were nocturnal. In the second experiment, the authors found that diurnal and nocturnal wheel-runners were indistinguishable with respect to the timing of postpartum mating, which always occurred in the hours before lights-on. Here they also found that both juvenile and adult A. niloticus exhibited diurnal patterns of general activity when housed without a wheel, even if they exhibited nocturnal activity when housed with a wheel. In the third experiment, the authors discovered that adult female A. niloticus with nocturnal patterns of wheel-running were also nocturnal with respect to general activity and core body temperature when a running wheel was available, but they were diurnal when the running wheel was removed. Finally, a field study revealed that all A. niloticus were almost exclusively diurnal in their natural habitat. Together these results suggest that individuals of this species are fundamentally diurnal but that access to a running wheel shifts some individuals to a nocturnal pattern.},

We have used internally marked mosaics to determine the anatomical locations at which per expression is required for adult rhythmicity, and thus where the fly's circadian pacemaker is likely located in this holometabolous insect. We first provide a detailed description of the distribution and nature of per-expressing cells in the fly's CNS. Using an antibody to the per gene product, or to that of a reporter of per expression, in conjunction with an antibody to the embryonic lethal-abnormal visual system (elav) gene product--which is used as a marker of neuronal identity--we have experimentally confirmed previously proposed assignments of per-expressing cells to the neuronal and glial classes. Thus, we found that per expression and elav immunoreactivity colocalized in large cells located in the lateral cortex of the central brain, as well as in more dorsally located cells in the posterior central brain. In contrast, we found that cells located at the margins of the cortex and the neuropil, and within the neuropil, as well as smaller cortical cells found throughout the brain's cortex, were elav negative, supporting the notion that they are glial in nature. Using internally marked mosaics, we find that the pacemaker is located in brain but is not exclusive to the eyes, the ocelli, or the optic lobes, which is consistent with previous reports obtained in this and other insects of this class. Although the pacemaker may be a paired structure, we show that the functioning of one of them is sufficient for rhythmicity. Finally, we report that glial expression is sufficient for some behavioral rhythmicity to be manifest. However, the rhythmicities of animals for which per expression was confined to glia were weak, suggesting that neuronal per expression as well may be required for normal pacemaker function.},

	abstract = {Circadian clocks are centrally involved in the regulation of daily behavioural and physiological processes. These clocks are synchronized to the 24 h day by external cues (Zeitgeber), the most important of which is the light–dark cycle. In polar environments, however, the strength of the Zeitgeber is greatly reduced around the summer and winter solstices (continuous daylight or continuous darkness). How animals time their behaviour under such conditions has rarely been studied in the wild. Using a radio-telemetry-based system, we investigated daily activity rhythms under continuous daylight in Barrow, Alaska, throughout the breeding season in four bird species that differ in mating system and parental behaviour. We found substantial diversity in daily activity rhythms depending on species, sex and breeding stage. Individuals exhibited either robust, entrained 24 h activity cycles, were continuously active (arrhythmic) or showed ‘free-running’ activity cycles. In semipalmated sandpipers, a shorebird with biparental incubation, we show that the free-running rhythm is synchronized between pair mates. The diversity of diel time-keeping under continuous daylight emphasizes the plasticity of the circadian system, and the importance of the social and life-history context. Our results support the idea that circadian behaviour can be adaptively modified to enable species-specific time-keeping under polar conditions.},

	abstract = {A major factor contributing to the evolution of mammals was their ability to be active during the night, a niche previously underused by terrestrial vertebrates. Diurnality subsequently reemerged multiple times in a variety of independent lineages. This paper reviews some recent data on circadian mechanisms in diurnal mammals and considers general themes that appear to be emerging from this work. Careful examination of behavioral studies suggests that although subtle differences may exist, the fundamental functions of the circadian system are the same, as seems to be the case with respect to the molecular mechanisms of the clock. This suggests that responses to signals originating in the clock must be different, either within the SCN or at its targets or downstream from them. Some features of the SCN vary from species to species, but none of these has been clearly associated with diurnality. The region immediately dorsal to the SCN, which receives substantial input from it, exhibits dramatically different rhythms in nocturnal lab rats and diurnal grass rats. This raises the possibility that it functions as a relay that transforms the signal emitted by the SCN and transmits different patterns to downstream targets in nocturnal and diurnal animals. Other direct targets of the SCN include neurons containing orexin and those containing gonadotropin-releasing hormone, and both of these populations of cells exhibit patterns of rhythmicity that are inverted in at least one diurnal compared to one nocturnal species. The patterns that emerge from the data on diurnality are discussed in terms of the implications they have for the evolution and neural substrates of a day-active way of life.},

	abstract = {The temporal distribution of behavioral programs throughout the 24-h day, known as temporal niche of a species, is determined by ecological factors that directly affect the adaptive value of the timing of specific behaviors. Temporal niche switching has been described in several species and is likely adaptive in habitats where the daily timing of those factors changes. Benthic species whose habitats span a wide range of water depths are exposed to considerable depth-dependent environmental changes. Temporally scheduled trawl surveys of the Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus, reveal that animals emerge from burrows at night on the shallow shelf (10-50 m deep), at crepuscular hours on the lower shelf (50-200 m), and at daytime on the slope (200-400 m). The mechanisms underlying nocturnality/diurnality switches are chiefly unknown, and Nephrops offers a unique model for their study. The depth-dependent decrease in luminance is a likely candidate determining the temporal distribution of behavior. The authors explored this possibility in the laboratory by exposing Nephrops to light:dark (LD) cycles of 470-nm monochromatic lighting that mimic conditions at the 100-m-deep shelf (10 lux) or the 300-m slope (0.1 lux). Two groups of animals were respectively exposed to each light intensity according to the following protocol: an initial 12:12 LD stage followed by constant darkness (DD), followed in turn by a second 12:12 LD stage. Activity at the burrow opening (door-keeping = DK), as well as full emergence (E), was continuously monitored. Under 10-lux LD cycles, most animals showed nocturnal DK activity?with some being crepuscular or diurnal?and all animals showed nocturnal E activity. In contrast, both behaviors were clearly diurnal in animals under 0.1-lux LD cycles. The phase of the nocturnal and diurnal DK rhythms detected respectively at 10 and 0.1 lux upon release into DD revealed that these rhythms are entrained circadian rhythms. The present data indicate that nocturnality/diurnality switches in Nephrops in its natural habitat, evidenced by captures at different depths, are likely determined by light intensity. This temporal niche switching involves different patterns of photic entrainment, leading to bona fide circadian diurnal or nocturnal phenotypes, as well as exogenous masking of behavioral outputs.},

	abstract = {A compilation of more than 30 studies shows that adult Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) may frequent benthic habitats year?round, in shelf as well as oceanic waters and throughout their circumpolar range. Net and acoustic data from the Scotia Sea show that in summer 2?20\% of the population reside at depths between 200 and 2000 m, and that large aggregations can form above the seabed. Local differences in the vertical distribution of krill indicate that reduced feeding success in surface waters, either due to predator encounter or food shortage, might initiate such deep migrations and results in benthic feeding. Fatty acid and microscopic analyses of stomach content confirm two different foraging habitats for Antarctic krill: the upper ocean, where fresh phytoplankton is the main food source, and deeper water or the seabed, where detritus and copepods are consumed. Krill caught in upper waters retain signals of benthic feeding, suggesting frequent and dynamic exchange between surface and seabed. Krill contained up to 260 nmol iron per stomach when returning from seabed feeding. About 5\% of this iron is labile, i.e., potentially available to phytoplankton. Due to their large biomass, frequent benthic feeding, and acidic digestion of particulate iron, krill might facilitate an input of new iron to Southern Ocean surface waters. Deep migrations and foraging at the seabed are significant parts of krill ecology, and the vertical fluxes involved in this behavior are important for the coupling of benthic and pelagic food webs and their elemental repositories.},

	abstract = {Abstract Polar environments are characterized by discrete periods of continuous light or darkness during the summer and winter months, respectively. Because the light/dark cycle serves as the primary Zeitgeber to synchronize rhythms of most organisms, its seasonal absence in polar regions poses challenges to the circadian organization of organisms that reside in these environments. Although some species become arrhythmic, others, such as migratory songbirds, are able to maintain an intact diurnal rhythm during polar summer. This suggests that birds may switch to alternative environmental cues, such as daily changes in light intensity and ambient temperature, which may have the potential to reset the biological clock. However, identifying the low?amplitude Zeitgeber that synchronizes rhythms in free?living polar?dwelling animals has been difficult to demonstrate. In this study, we measured behavioral and melatonin profiles of free?living Lapland longspurs (Calcarius lapponicus) near Barrow, Alaska (71°N) during the continuous daylight of summer in the Arctic. Diel cycles in activity and male singing were apparent throughout the polar day with a quiescence period of 4?5?hr starting around 24:00 Alaska Daylight Time. This inactivity corresponded with elevated melatonin profiles. In contrast, territorial aggression of males in response to a conspecific intruder was not dependent upon time?of?day. Diel changes in light intensity and ambient temperature were negatively associated with daily melatonin profiles after taking into account time?of?day effects. These results suggest that photic and thermal cues may act either as alternative Zeitgeber cues, or possibly masking agents. Distinguishing between these two possibilities will require further study.

	abstract = {Although evolutionary ecologists agree that proximate and ultimate aspects are two sides of one coin, they are seldom interested in studies on physiological and behavioural mechanisms at the base of ecological phenomena. Nevertheless, these mechanisms are objects of selection and evolved to realise adaptive significances. This paper is a plea to bring both fields closer together, and, by means of an example of Diel Vertical Migration of Daphnia, some proximate and ultimate aspects are discussed. It is argued that light changes, not fish kairomone, is the primary cause for an individual to swim downwards at dawn and upwards at dusk. However, what is called a causal factor might differ when ecosystems or individuals are studied. In addition, causality in ecology is not simple, and has the character of a `set of necessary conditions'. To illustrate the importance of proximate analyses in DVM, two basic response mechanisms are discussed: Photobehaviour system 1 and 2. The physiological character of these systems leads to a fixed type of migration or to a phenotypically induced DVM, respectively. The adaptive significance of the first might be a reduction of the hazardous effects of UV radiation and of the second a lowering of mortality due to visually hunting predators.},

	abstract = {Marine copepods commonly exhibit vertical movements in the water column over the diel cycle, termed diel vertical migration (DVM), with the most common pattern being an ascent in the water column to minimum depth around sunset and descent to maximum depth around sunrise. The present study characterized the DVM pattern of the pontellid copepod Calanopia americana Dahl in the Newport River estuary (North Carolina, USA, in July 2003). The estuary is shallow and well-mixed, and the study site (34°43′N; 76°40′W), 1.5 km inside the estuary entrance, is unusual in lying within a gyre where tidal currents are always in the seaward direction. Changes in C. americana vertical abundance were related to spectrally relevant changes in light throughout the diel cycle. Simultaneous measurements of light and zooplankton abundance near the surface (0.5 m depth) and near the bottom (0.5 m above bottom) were made over one 4-h period and two 3-day periods during different phases of the tide. These observations suggest that C. americana undertook twilight DVM in the Newport River estuary; an ascent to the surface occurred at sunset, followed by a descent to near the bottom around midnight, with a second ascent to the surface and then descent to near bottom at sunrise. DVM in C. americana was independent of the tidal cycle, with the initial ascent in the water column at sunset possibly associated with relative rates of irradiance change. Copepod vertical movements were consistent with a night-active endogenous rhythm, and appeared independent of the abundance of predatory chaetognaths, Sagitta spp. In DVM studies with migrators like C. americana that are broadly sensitive to visible wavelengths of light, measuring photosynthetically active radiation may be a reasonable alternative to measuring light in a spectrally relevant photometric unit.},

	abstract = {Abstract The cricket Modicogryllus siamensis Chopard shows photoperiod?dependent changes in the duration of nymphal development: nymphs become adult within 60?days after hatching, undergoing seven moults under long?day conditions, whereas, under short?day conditions, nymphal development takes much longer (approximately 180?days) with an increased number of moults. Because removal of the compound eyes alters this photoperiodic response, the eyes may be involved in light detection during the photoperiodic response. The role of opsins, expressed in the compound eye, is examined in the present study with reference to the photoperiodic response. Molecular cloning identifies cDNAs of three opsins, opsin?Ultra Violet (Ms'op?UV), opsin?Blue (Ms'op?B) and opsin?Long Wave (Ms'op?LW), and in situ hybridization reveals that the opsin genes are expressed in specific regions of the compound eye in a gene?specific manner. RNA interference (RNAi) technology using the opsin genes results in a partial disruption in the long?day responses; most of the treated crickets showed eight or more moults and up to 23.5\% show a prolonged nymphal period that is typical of short?day responses. Under short?day conditions, op?UV RNAi crickets show earlier adult development, whereas no distinct alterations are observed in op?B and op?LW RNAi insects. The results suggest that the opsin genes may play differential roles in the photoperiodic response in the cricket and that the results can be at least partially explained in terms of the external coincidence model of photoperiodic time measurement.},

Clock RNA interference (RNAi) disrupts the circadian rhythm in an alternating deposition of polarized and nonpolarized cuticle layers in the endocuticle, and produces only a polarized layer. This indicates that Clock is a core component of the circadian clock and that it acts as a positive element in activating the transcription of downstream genes. In addition, Clock RNAi suppresses ovarian development irrespective of day?length conditions, which indicates that Clock is involved in the photoperiodic response. The observed phenotypes in Clock RNAi insects, the production of a single polarized layer in the endocuticle and an arrested ovarian development irrespective of photoperiod are the same as those induced by RNAi of cycle, a positive element in the circadian clock. However, the phenotypes induced by RNAi of negative elements period and mammalian?type cryptochrome differ from those induced by the positive elements. Considering the current data together with previously published findings, it is concluded that the circadian clock, comprising the circadian clock genes, is involved in the photoperiodic response of R. pedestris.},

Our previous results indicated that the locus npd could code for the timeless gene and its product might represent a molecular link between circadian and photoperiodic clock systems. Here we present results of tim mRNA (real time-PCR) and TIM protein (immunohistochemistry) analyses in the larval brain. TIM protein was localized in 2 neurons of each brain hemisphere of the 4-d-old 3rd instar wild-type larvae. In a marked contrast, no TIM neurons were detected in the brain of 4-day-old 3rd instar npd -mutant larvae and the level of tim transcripts was approximately 10-fold lower in the NPD than in the wild-type strain. Daily changes in tim expression and TIM presence appeared to be under photoperiodic control in the wild-type larvae. Clear daily oscillations of tim transcription were observed during the development of 3rd instars under the short-day conditions. Daily oscillations were less apparent under the long-day conditions, where a gradual increase of tim transcript abundance appeared as a prevailing trend. Analysis of the genomic structure of tim gene revealed that npd-mutants carry a 1855 bp-long deletion in the 5?-UTR region. This deletion removed the start of transcription and promoter regulatory motifs E-box and TER-box. The authors hypothesize that this mutation was responsible for dramatic reduction of tim transcription rates, disruption of circadian clock function, and disruption of photoperiodic calendar function in npd-mutant larvae of C. costata.},

Exposure to as few as 70 days of photoperiodic information a year is sufficient to synchronize the rhythm. The present study was conducted to identify which portions of the photoperiodic cycle are utilized for synchronization. For this purpose, we used pinealectomized ewes that could not respond reproductively to changes in day length. Selected photoperiodic information was provided via infusion of melatonin, a hormone that provides the neuroendocrine code for day length in this species. Melatonin was delivered according to circadian patterns. The infusion patterns were tailored to mimic those of melatonin secretion in pineal-intact ewes during one of the four seasons: winter, spring, summer, or autumn. The infusions were provided for 90 days a year during each of the three years following pinealectomy. The ewes were ovariectomized and treated with constant-release Silastic capsules containing estradiol; reproductive neuroendocrine activity was monitored by measurement of serum concentrations of LH. In the absence of exogenous melatonin, most (19 of 24) pinealectomized controls exhibited circannual LH cycles that were not in synchrony, indicating that the rhythm was free-running. Melatonin synchronized the rhythm (such that the period was 365 days and the stages of the rhythm were both concurrent among animals and in appropriate phase with the geophysical year), but not all melatonin patterns were equally effective in this regard. The most effective melatonin patterns mimicked those of secretion during summer. Spring and autumn melatonin patterns were less effective, and winter melatonin patterns were ineffective. These results support the concept that there is a seasonal specificity with regard to the photoperiodic cues that synchronize the circannual rhythm of reproductive neuroendocrine activity in the ewe. The rhythm is synchronized most effectively by long-day photoperiodic cues perceived on or around the summer solstice.},

	abstract = {Endogenous circannual clocks are found in many long-lived organisms, but are best studied in mammal and bird species. Circannual clocks are synchronized with the environment by changes in photoperiod, light intensity and possibly temperature and seasonal rainfall patterns. Annual timing mechanisms are presumed to have important ultimate functions in seasonally regulating reproduction, moult, hibernation, migration, body weight and fat deposition/stores. Birds that live in habitats where environmental cues such as photoperiod are poor predictors of seasons (e.g. equatorial residents, migrants to equatorial/tropical latitudes) rely more on their endogenous clocks than birds living in environments that show a tight correlation between photoperiod and seasonal events. Such population-specific/interspecific variation in reliance on endogenous clocks may indicate that annual timing mechanisms are adaptive. However, despite the apparent adaptive importance of circannual clocks, (i) what specific adaptive value they have in the wild and (ii) how they function are still largely untested. Whereas circadian clocks are hypothesized to be generated by molecular feedback loops, it has been suggested that circannual clocks are either based upon (i) a de-multiplication (‘counting’) of circadian days, (ii) a sequence of interdependent physiological states, or (iii) one or more endogenous oscillators, similar to circadian rhythms. We tested the de-multiplication of days (i) versus endogenous regulation hypotheses (ii) and (iii) in captive male and female house sparrows (Passer domesticus). We assessed the period of reproductive (testicular and follicular) cycles in four groups of birds kept either under photoperiods of LD 12 L : 12 D (period length: 24 h), 13.5 L : 13.5 D (27 h), 10.5 L : 10.5 D (23 h) or 12 D : 8 L : 3 D : 1 L (24-h skeleton photoperiod), respectively, for 15 months. Contrary to predictions from the de-multiplication hypothesis, individuals experiencing 27-h days did not differ (i.e. did not have longer) annual reproductive rhythms than individuals from the 21- or 24-h day groups. However, in line with predictions from endogenous regulation, birds in the skeleton group had significantly longer circannual period lengths than all other groups. Birds exposed to skeleton photoperiods experienced fewer light hours per year than all other groups (3285 versus 4380) and had a lower daily energy expenditure, as tested during one point of the annual cycle using respirometry. Although our results are tantalizing, they are still preliminary as birds were only studied over a period of 15 months. Nevertheless, the present data fail to support a ‘counting of circadian days’ and instead support hypotheses proposing whole-organism processes as the mechanistic basis for circannual rhythms. We propose a novel energy turnover hypothesis which predicts a dependence of the speed of the circannual clock on the overall energy expenditure of an organism.},

Birds were subjected to an aberrant light–dark (LD) cycle (3.5 h L:3.5 h D; T7, where T is the period length of the LD cycle) and continuous light (LL, 24 h L:0 h D), with controls on 12 h L:12 h D (T24, 24 h LD cycle). We measured the behavioural activity pattern of the birds and 24 h mRNA oscillations of circadian clock genes (bmal1, clock, per2, cry1, cry2) in the hypothalamus, the putative site of seasonal timing. Diurnal munia were rhythmic in behaviour with the period of the activity–rest cycle matched to T7 and T24, and became behaviourally arrhythmic with activity scattered throughout 24 h under LL. Similarly, exposure to 3.5 h L:3.5 h D and LL caused arrhythmicity in 24 h clock gene expression, suggesting disruption of internal circadian timing at the transcriptional level; a significant rhythm was found under 12 h L:12 h D. During an exposure of 80 weeks, munia showed two to three cycles of testis maturation and wing primaries moult under all photoperiods, although with a longer period under 12L:12D. Thus, the frequency of light period under 3.5 h L:3.5 h D or LL disrupted circadian clock gene cycles, but did not affect the generation of circannual testis and moult cycles. We conclude that the prevailing light environment and hypothalamic circadian gene cycles do not exert direct control on the timing of the annual reproductive cycle in spotted munia, suggesting independent generation of the circadian and circannual rhythms in seasonally breeding species.},

	abstract = {Phytoplankton are the base of the Antarctic food web, sustain the wealth and diversity of life for which Antarctica is renowned, and play a critical role in biogeochemical cycles that mediate global climate. Over the vast expanse of the Southern Ocean (SO), the climate is variously predicted to experience increased warming, strengthening wind, acidification, shallowing mixed layer depths, increased light (and UV), changes in upwelling and nutrient replenishment, declining sea ice, reduced salinity, and the southward migration of ocean fronts. These changes are expected to alter the structure and function of phytoplankton communities in the SO. The diverse environments contained within the vast expanse of the SO will be impacted differently by climate change; causing the identity and the magnitude of environmental factors driving biotic change to vary within and among bioregions. Predicting the net effect of multiple climate-induced stressors over a range of environments is complex. Yet understanding the response of SO phytoplankton to climate change is vital if we are to predict the future state/s of the ecosystem, estimate the impacts on fisheries and endangered species, and accurately predict the effects of physical and biotic change in the SO on global climate. This review looks at the major environmental factors that define the structure and function of phytoplankton communities in the SO, examines the forecast changes in the SO environment, predicts the likely effect of these changes on phytoplankton, and considers the ramifications for trophodynamics and feedbacks to global climate change. Predictions strongly suggest that all regions of the SO will experience changes in phytoplankton productivity and community composition with climate change. The nature, and even the sign, of these changes varies within and among regions and will depend upon the magnitude and sequence in which these environmental changes are imposed. It is likely that predicted changes to phytoplankton communities will affect SO biogeochemistry, carbon export, and nutrition for higher trophic levels.},

Research cruises conducted around the South Shetland Islands of the Antarctic Peninsula during winters with contrasting ice conditions provide the first acoustic estimates of krill biomass, habitat use, and association with top predators to examine potential interactions with the krill fishery. Krill abundance was very low in offshore waters during all winters. In Bransfield Strait, median krill abundance was an order of magnitude higher (8 krill m-2) compared to summer (0.25 krill m-2), and this pattern was observed in all winters regardless of ice cover. Acoustic estimates of krill biomass were also an order of magnitude higher ({\textasciitilde}5500000 metric tons [t] in 2014) than a 15 yr summer average (520000 t). Looking at krill-dependent predators, during winter, crabeater seals Lobodon carcinophagus were concentrated in Bransfield Strait where ice provided habitat, while Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella were more broadly distributed. Krill overwinter in coastal basin environments independent of ice and primary production and in an area that is becoming more frequently ice-free. While long-term projections of climate change have focused on changing krill habitat and productivity declines, more immediate impacts of ongoing climate change include increased risks of negative fishery-krill-predator interactions, alteration of upper trophic level community structure, and changes in the pelagic ecology of this system. Development of management strategies to mitigate the increased risk to krill populations and their dependent predators over management timescales will be necessary to minimize the impacts of long-term climate change.},

Experimental krill species were obtained from the Antarctic (South Georgia area), the Humboldt Current System (HCS, Chilean coast) and the Northern California Current System (NCCS, Oregon). Euphausia mucronata from the HCS showed oxyconforming pO2-dependent respiration below 80\% air saturation (18 kPa). Normoxic subsurface oxygenation in winter posed a ‘high oxygen stress’ for this species. The NCCS krill, Euphausia pacifica, and the Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, maintained respiration rates constant down to low critical pO2 values of 6 kPa (30\% air saturation) and 11 kPa (55\% air saturation), respectively. Antarctic krill had low antioxidant enzyme activities, but high concentrations of the molecular antioxidant glutathione (GSH) and was not lethally affected by 6 h exposure to moderate hypoxia. The temperate krill species (E. pacifica) had higher superoxide dismutase (SOD) values in winter than in summer, which relates to a higher winter metabolic rate. In all species, antioxidant enzyme activities remained constant during hypoxic exposure at the typical temperature for their habitat. Warming by 7 °C above habitat temperature in summer increased SOD activities and GSH levels in E. mucronata (HCS), but no oxidative damage occurred. In winter, when the NCCS is well mixed and the OMZ is deeper, +4 °C of warming combined with hypoxia represents a lethal condition for E. pacifica. In summer, when the OMZ expands upwards (100 m subsurface), antioxidant defences counteracted hypoxia and reoxygenation effects in E. pacifica, but only at mildly elevated temperature (+2 °C). In this season, experimental warming by +4 °C reduced antioxidant activities and the combination of warming with hypoxia again caused mortality of exposed specimens. We conclude that a climate change scenario combining warming and hypoxia represents a serious threat to E. pacifica and, as a consequence, NCCS food webs.},

	abstract = {Summary
Animals living in temperate zones anticipate seasonal environmental changes to adapt their biological functions, especially reproduction and metabolism. Two main physiological mechanisms have evolved for this adaptation: intrinsic long-term timing mechanisms with an oscillating period of approximately 1 year, driven by a circannual clock [1], and synchronization of biological rhythms to the sidereal year using day length (photoperiod) [2]. In mammals, the pineal hormone melatonin relays photoperiodic information to the hypothalamus to control seasonal physiology through well-defined mechanisms [3, 4, 5, 6]. In contrast, little is known about how the circannual clock drives endogenous changes in seasonal functions. The aim of this study was to determine whether genes involved in photoperiodic time measurement (TSHβ and Dio2) and central control of reproduction (Rfrp and Kiss1) display circannual rhythms in expression under constant conditions. Male European hamsters, deprived of seasonal time cues by pinealectomy and maintenance in constant photoperiod, were selected when expressing a subjective summer or subjective winter state in their circannual cycle of body weight, temperature, and testicular size. TSHβ expression in the pars tuberalis (PT) displayed a robust circannual variation with highest level in the subjective summer state, which was positively correlated with hypothalamic Dio2 and Rfrp expression. The negative sex steroid feedback was found to act specifically on arcuate Kiss1 expression. Our findings reveal TSH as a circannual output of the PT, which in turn regulates hypothalamic neurons controlling reproductive activity. Therefore, both the circannual and the melatonin signals converge on PT TSHβ expression to synchronize seasonal biological activity.},

The increasing occurrence of endocrine disruption problems caused by environmental pollutants, which interfere in particular with reproductive physiology of vertebrates but also of invertebrates has made necessary to better understand the endocrine physiology of the latter and the role of steroids in these processes. So many attempts are being made to better understand the endocrine roles of steroids in arthropods and molluscs, and to establish whether they also fulfill similar functions in other invertebrate phyla. At the moment, both the precise identification of these steroids, the determination of their origin (endogenous versus exogenous) and of their mechanism of action are under active investigation. This research takes profit of the development of genome sequencing programs on many invertebrate species, which allow the identification of receptors and/or biosynthetic enzymes, when related to their vertebrate counterparts, but the story is not so simple, as will be exemplified by estrogen receptors of molluscs.},

Octopamine biosynthesis requires tyrosine decarboxylase to convert tyrosine into tyramine and tyramine β-hydroxylase to convert tyramine into octopamine. We identified and characterized a Caenorhabditis elegans tyrosine decarboxylase gene, tdc-1, and a tyramine β-hydroxylase gene, tbh-1. The TBH-1 protein is expressed in a subset of TDC-1-expressing cells, indicating that C. elegans has tyraminergic cells that are distinct from its octopaminergic cells. tdc-1 mutants have behavioral defects not shared by tbh-1 mutants. We show that tyramine plays a specific role in the inhibition of egg laying, the modulation of reversal behavior, and the suppression of head oscillations in response to anterior touch. We propose a model for the neural circuit that coordinates locomotion and head oscillations in response to anterior touch. Our findings establish tyramine as a neurotransmitter in C. elegans, and we suggest that tyramine is a genuine neurotransmitter in other invertebrates and possibly in vertebrates as well.},

	abstract = {We have examined three potential targets of octopamine action of the lobster--hemolymph, heart and exoskeletal muscle--and found that each tissue responds to the amine with increases in cyclic adenosine 3': 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) and changes in measurable physiological phenomena. A highly specific octopamine-stimulated increase in cAMP is observed in hemolymph, and this effect is probably due to the presence of a unique octopamine receptor on hematocytes. Pharmacological studies show that synephrine is a potent agonist of the hemolymph receptor for octopamine and that the alpha adrenergic receptor blockers phentolamine and dibenamine and the dopamine receptor blocker, chlorpromazine, are antagonists. Addition of octopamine to lobster hemolymph increases the rate of changes the nature of the clotting reaction. AMP levels in lobster heart are elevated by both octopamine and serotonin. Both amines also increase the rate and the amplitude of the heart beat. Octopamine, serotonin and dopamine all increase cAMP levels in lobster exoskeletal muscle preparations, and each amine causes changes in muscle tension and the strength of nerve evoked contractions. In none of the tissues studied have we been able to establish a direct relationship between amine-stimulated increases in cAMP levels and the physiological responses.},

We have shown that alternative splicing can be dynamically regulated in response to membrane depolarization and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) activation, through special CaM kinase responsive RNA elements. However, proteins that mediate this regulation and how they are affected by CaMKIV are not known. Here we show that the regulation of the stress axis-regulated exon of the Slo1 potassium channel transcripts by membrane depolarization requires a highly conserved CaMKIV target serine (Ser-513) of the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein L. Ser-513 phosphorylation within the RNA recognition motif 4 enhanced heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein L interaction with the CaMKIV-responsive RNA element 1 of stress axis-regulated exon and inhibited binding of the large subunit of the U2 auxiliary factor U2AF65. Both of these activities were abolished by a S513A mutation. Thus, through Ser-513, membrane depolarization/calcium signaling controls a critical spliceosomal assembly step to regulate the variant subunit composition of potassium channels.},

Interestingly, light–dark cycles as well as high temperature facilitated a circadian control of behavioural activity. Based on these observations we propose that in addition to its coactivator function for circadian transcription, CBP is involved in the regulation of circadian behaviour down-stream of the circadian clock.},

R-spondins (RSPOs) are a group of secreted proteins that enhance Wnt/β-catenin signaling and have pleiotropic functions in development and stem cell growth. LGR5, an orphan receptor of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, is specifically expressed in stem cells of the intestinal crypt and hair follicle. Knockout of LGR5 in the mouse results in neonatal lethality. LGR4, a receptor closely related to LGR5, also has essential roles in development, as its knockout leads to reduced viability and retarded growth. Overexpression of both receptors has been reported in several types of cancer. Here we demonstrate that LGR4 and LGR5 bind the R-spondins with high affinity and mediate the potentiation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by enhancing Wnt-induced LRP6 phosphorylation. Interestingly, neither receptor is coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins or to β-arrestin when stimulated by the R-spondins, indicating a unique mechanism of action. The findings provide a basis for stem cell-specific effects of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and for the broad range of functions LGR4, LGR5, and the R-spondins have in normal and malignant growth.},

Here we show that the transmembrane proteins RTP1 and RTP2 promote functional cell surface expression of ORs expressed in HEK293T cells. Genes encoding these proteins are expressed specifically in olfactory neurons. These proteins are associated with OR proteins and enhance the OR responses to odorants. Similar although weaker effects were seen with a third protein, REEP1. These findings suggest that RTP1 and RTP2 in particular play significant roles in the translocation of ORs to the plasma membrane as well as in the functioning of ORs. We have used this approach to identify active odorant ligands for ORs, providing a platform for screening the chemical selectivity of the large OR family.},

Therefore, identification of the interacting sites in the signaling molecules can lead to the development of means to modulate these interactions. We applied this approach to study signal transduction by protein kinase C (PKC). We have previously identified potential PKC binding sites in two PKC binding proteins (annexin I and RACK1). Peptides derived from these sequences inhibit PKC binding to RACK1 in vitro. Here, we tested the ability of two of these peptides, I (KGDYEKILVALCGGN) and rVI (DIINALCF), to affect PKC-mediated function in vivo. The peptides were microinjected into Xenopus oocytes, and insulin- induced βPKC translocation and oocyte maturation were examined. The peptides had opposite activities on oocyte; peptide I inhibited whereas peptide rVI stimulated insulin-induced Xenopus oocyte maturation. As expected, βPKC translocation from the cytosol to the particulate fraction of the Xenopus oocytes was inhibited after microinjection of peptide I and induced after microinjection of peptide rVI. Moreover, peptide rVI caused translocation of βPKC and oocyte maturation without hormone stimulation. In the absence of PKC activators, peptide rVI but not peptide I, activated PKC in vitro as demonstrated in three assays: increased sensitivity to Arg-C endopeptidase, PKC autophosphorylation, and histone phosphorylation. Therefore, although peptides I and rVI have sequence homology, one mimicked hormone-induced PKC- mediated function whereas the other inhibited this hormone-induced function. The molecular mechanisms underlying these opposing effects of the peptides are discussed.},

In this study, the structural requirements for interaction between ceramide and CAPP were determined. d-erythro-C6 ceramide activated the catalytic subunit of PP2A (PP2Ac) approximately 3-fold in a stereospecific manner. In contrast, saturation of the 4-5 double bond, producing d-erythro-dihydro C6 ceramide, inhibited PP2Ac (IC50 = 8.5 μM). Furthermore, phyto C6 ceramide, d-erythro-dehydro C6 ceramide, and d-erythro-cis-C6 ceramide had no effect on PP2Ac activity. Modification of the sphingoid chain also abolished the ability of ceramide to activate PP2Ac. Further studies demonstrated the requirement for the amide group, the primary hydroxyl group, and the secondary hydroxyl group of the sphingoid backbone for activation of PP2Ac through the synthesis and evaluation of d-erythro-urea C6 ceramide, l-erythro-urea C6 ceramide, d-erythro-N-methyl C6 ceramide, d-erythro-1-O-methyl C6 ceramide, d-erythro-3-O-methyl C6 ceramide, and (2S) 3-keto C6 ceramide. None of these compounds induced significant activation of PP2Ac. Liposome binding studies were also conducted using analogs of d-erythro-C C6 ceramide, and the results showed that the ability of ceramide analogs to influence CAPP (activation or inhibition) was associated with the ability of the analogs to bind to CAPP.
This study demonstrates strict structural requirements for interaction of ceramide with CAPP, and disclose ceramide as a very specific regulator of CAPP. The studies also begin to define features that transform ceramide analogs into inhibitors of CAPP.},

	abstract = {To overcome the problem of getting crustaceans to reproduce in captivity, eyestalk ablation or X-organ sinus gland removal is commonly utilized in commercially important species such as shrimp. We have investigated the effect of unilateral and bilateral eyestalk ablation on methyl farnesoate (MF) production by mandibular organs (MOs) and on ovarian maturation in female spider crabs Libinia emarginata, a useful model since these animals are in a terminal molt and are devoid of a functional Y-organ. Non-reproductive, over-wintering female L. emarginata were induced to be reproductive by feeding and increasing the holding temperature to stimulate the endocrine system. In addition, we removed X-organ sinus glands by eyestalk ablation either unilaterally (UEA) or bilaterally (BEA) to further stimulate MF synthesis by MOs. Endogenous MF in the hemolymph was extracted and quantified by means of HPLC and in some cases by GC/MS. Oocyte growth and egg quality were studied simultaneously to determine how they were related to MF levels found during vitellogenesis. The initial MF concentration in unablated controls was low, 0.31 ng/ml of hemolymph, and this increased (p{\textless}0.05) to about 1 ng/ml by 2 weeks, remaining at about that level for the remainder of the experiment. Eyestalk ablation significantly stimulated MF concentrations by week 1 to nearly 2 and 3.5ng/ml in the UEA (p {\textless}0.01) and BEA (p {\textless}0.001) animals, respectively. Oocytes appeared to respond to increased MF levels, as ovarian maturation was initiated from the point at which MF increased (p {\textless}0.05). Thereafter, the rate of oocyte growth was directly correlated with the extent of elevation of MF. The gonado-somatic index [(GSI) = gonad weight/body weight × 100] of controls at the start was about 1.5 and increased to 6.5 by week 4. Mature oocytes were reached at a GSI around 7. Oocyte maturation was accomplished at week 2 in BEA, week 3 in UEA, and later than week 4 in controls. After maturation, oocytes started to degrade in some ablated animals, particularly in the bilaterally ablated ones where the highest MF concentrations were observed. These data indicate that MF elevations are required for stimulating ovarian maturation in Crustacea. MF appears to accelerate gonad development during the vitellogenic process, but may be deleterious at high concentrations. These results have a significant and important application and implications for aquaculture.},

	abstract = {Glycosylation plays crucial regulatory roles in various biological processes such as development, immunity, and neural functions. For example, α1,3-fucosylation, the addition of a fucose moiety abundant in Drosophila neural cells, is essential for neural development, function, and behavior. However, it remains largely unknown how neural-specific α1,3-fucosylation is regulated. In the present study, we searched for genes involved in the glycosylation of a neural-specific protein using a Drosophila RNAi library. We obtained 109 genes affecting glycosylation that clustered into nine functional groups. Among them, members of the RNA regulation group were enriched by a secondary screen that identified genes specifically regulating α1,3-fucosylation. Further analyses revealed that an RNA–binding protein, second mitotic wave missing (Swm), upregulates expression of the neural-specific glycosyltransferase FucTA and facilitates its mRNA export from the nucleus. This first large-scale genetic screen for glycosylation-related genes has revealed novel regulation of fucTA mRNA in neural cells.},

	abstract = {Neurotrophic interactions occur in Drosophila, but to date, no neurotrophic factor had been found. Neurotrophins are the main vertebrate secreted signalling molecules that link nervous system structure and function: they regulate neuronal survival, targeting, synaptic plasticity, memory and cognition. We have identified a neurotrophic factor in flies, Drosophila Neurotrophin (DNT1), structurally related to all known neurotrophins and highly conserved in insects. By investigating with genetics the consequences of removing DNT1 or adding it in excess, we show that DNT1 maintains neuronal survival, as more neurons die in DNT1 mutants and expression of DNT1 rescues naturally occurring cell death, and it enables targeting by motor neurons. We show that Spätzle and a further fly neurotrophin superfamily member, DNT2, also have neurotrophic functions in flies. Our findings imply that most likely a neurotrophin was present in the common ancestor of all bilateral organisms, giving rise to invertebrate and vertebrate neurotrophins through gene or whole-genome duplications. This work provides a missing link between aspects of neuronal function in flies and vertebrates, and it opens the opportunity to use Drosophila to investigate further aspects of neurotrophin function and to model related diseases., Members of the neurotrophin superfamily mediate critical roles in neuronal survival and targeting in the fruit flyDrosophila. Although this is an accepted role for neurotrophins in vertebrates, scant previous evidence has been able to demonstrate such a conserved role in invertebrates.},

The structural basis of the bathochromic shift mechanism has long been elusive. A change in color occurs from the orange red of the unbound dilute AXT (λmax 472 nm in hexane), the well-known color of cooked lobster, to slate blue in the protein-bound live lobster state (λmax 632 nm in CR). Intriguingly, extracted CR becomes red on dehydration and on rehydration goes back to blue. Recently, the innovative use of softer x-rays and xenon derivatization yielded the three-dimensional structure of the A1 apoprotein subunit of CR, confirming it as a member of the lipocalin superfamily. That work provided the molecular replacement search model for a crystal form of the β-CR holo complex, that is an A1 with A3 subunit assembly including two bound AXT molecules. We have thereby determined the structure of the A3 molecule de novo. Lobster has clearly evolved an intricate structural mechanism for the coloration of its shell using AXT and a bathochromic shift. Blue/purple AXT proteins are ubiquitous among invertebrate marine animals, particularly the Crustacea. The three-dimensional structure of β-CR has identified the protein contacts and structural alterations needed for the AXT color regulation mechanism.},

In a microarray analysis of JH-induced gene expression in abdominal integument, we found that Krüppel homolog 1 (Kr-h1) was up-regulated during most of adult development. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that Kr-h1 up-regulation began at 10 h after puparium formation (APF), and Kr-h1 up-regulation occurred in imaginal epidermal cells, persisting larval muscles, and larval oenocytes. Ectopic expression of Kr-h1 in abdominal epidermis using T155-Gal4 to drive UAS-Kr-h1 resulted in missing or short bristles in the dorsal midline. This phenotype was similar to that seen after a low dose of JH or after misexpression of br between 21–30 h APF. Ectopic expression of Kr-h1 prolonged the expression of BR protein in the pleura and the dorsal tergite. No Kr-h1 was seen after misexpression of br. Thus, Kr-h1 mediates some of the JH signaling in the adult abdominal epidermis and is upstream of br in this pathway. We also show for the first time that the JH-mediated maintenance of br expression in this epidermis is patterned and that JH delays the fusion of the imaginal cells and the disappearance of Dpp in the dorsal midline.},

	abstract = {Elaborate regulation of insect metamorphosis is the consequence of physiological cooperation among multiple endocrine factors such as juvenile hormones (JHs) and ecdysteroids. Hormone-induced transcription factors play important roles in substantive interactions between hormonal signaling pathways. In insects, zinc finger transcription factor Krüppel homolog 1 (Kr-h1) is a key gene of the endocrine signaling pathway in which it is directly upregulated by JH receptor Methoprene-tolerant (Met) in the presence of JH and then regulates multiple downstream factors, including components of the ecdysteroid signaling pathway. Although JH also plays a role in various biological phenomena in other arthropod species, little is known about the molecular basis of the JH signaling pathway. Here we cloned Kr-h1 from a branchiopod crustacean, Daphnia pulex, (DappuKr-h1) and analyzed its expression profile and developmental function together with consideration of its relationship to the JH signaling pathway. We suggest that DappuKr-h1 lacks JH responsiveness and regulatory relationship with the JH receptor. Moreover our loss-of-function analysis revealed that maternal mRNA of DappuKr-h1 plays a critical role in early development independent from the JH signaling pathway. These findings provide insights about whether and how the JH signaling pathway influenced evolution, leading to greater diversity in phylum Arthropoda.},

	abstract = {In animals, visual pigments are essential for photoreceptor function and survival. These G-protein-coupled receptors consist of a protein moiety (opsin) and a covalently bound 11-cis-retinylidene chromophore. The chromophore is derived from dietary carotenoids by oxidative cleavage and trans-to-cis isomerization of double bonds. In vertebrates, the necessary chemical transformations are catalyzed by two distinct but structurally related enzymes, the carotenoid oxygenase β-carotenoid-15,15′-monooxygenase and the retinoid isomerase RPE65 (retinal pigment epithelium protein of 65 kDa). Recently, we provided biochemical evidence that these reactions in insects are catalyzed by a single enzyme family member named NinaB. Here we show that in the fly pathway, carotenoids are mandatory precursors of the chromophore. After chromophore formation, the retinoid-binding protein Pinta acts downstream of NinaB and is required to supply photoreceptors with chromophore. Like ninaE encoding the opsin, ninaB expression is eye-dependent and is activated as a downstream target of the eyeless/pax6 and sine oculis master control genes for eye development. The requirement for coordinated synthesis of chromophore and opsin is evidenced by analysis of ninaE mutants. Retinal degeneration in opsin-deficient photoreceptors is caused by the chromophore and can be prevented by restricting its supply as seen in an opsin and chromophore-deficient double mutant. Thus, our study identifies NinaB as a key component for visual pigment production and provides evidence that chromophore in opsin-deficient photoreceptors can elicit retinal degeneration.},

	abstract = {A rich chapter in the history of insect endocrinology has focused on hormonal control of diapause, especially the major roles played by juvenile hormones (JHs), ecdysteroids, and the neuropeptides that govern JH and ecdysteroid synthesis. More recently, experiments with adult diapause in Drosophila melanogaster and the mosquito Culex pipiens, and pupal diapause in the flesh fly Sarcophaga crassipalpis provide strong evidence that insulin signaling is also an important component of the regulatory pathway leading to the diapause phenotype. Insects produce many different insulin-like peptides (ILPs), and not all are involved in the diapause response; ILP-1 appears to be the one most closely linked to diapause in C. pipiens. Many steps in the pathway leading from perception of daylength (the primary environmental cue used to program diapause) to generation of the diapause phenotype remain unknown, but the role for insulin signaling in mosquito diapause appears to be upstream of JH, as evidenced by the fact that application of exogenous JH can rescue the effects of knocking down expression of ILP-1 or the Insulin Receptor. Fat accumulation, enhancement of stress tolerance, and other features of the diapause phenotype are likely linked to the insulin pathway through the action of a key transcription factor, FOXO. This review highlights many parallels for the role of insulin signaling as a regulator in insect diapause and dauer formation in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.},

Compared with other de novo transcriptome assemblers, Trinity recovers more full-length transcripts across a broad range of expression levels, with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments.

This issue is particularly important for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies in the absence of sequenced genomes, as it is difficult to determine which transcripts are isoforms of the same gene. A second significant issue is the design of RNA-Seq experiments, in terms of the number of reads, read length, and whether reads come from one or both ends of cDNA fragments.},

Its main goal is to provide the scientific community with a central resource for protein sequences and functional information. The UniProt consortium maintains the UniProt KnowledgeBase (UniProtKB) and several supplementary databases including the UniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef) and the UniProt Archive (UniParc). (1) UniProtKB is a comprehensive protein sequence knowledgebase that consists of two sections: UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, which contains manually annotated entries, and UniProtKB/TrEMBL, which contains computer-annotated entries. UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries contain information curated by biologists and provide users with cross-links to about 100 external databases and with access to additional information or tools. (2) The UniRef databases (UniRef100, UniRef90, and UniRef50) define clusters of protein sequences that share 100, 90, or 50\% identity. (3) The UniParc database stores and maps all publicly available protein sequence data, including obsolete data excluded from UniProtKB. The UniProt databases can be accessed online (http://www.uniprot.org/) or downloaded in several formats (ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub). New releases are published every 2 weeks. The purpose of this chapter is to present a guided tour of a UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry, paying particular attention to the specificities of plant protein annotation. We will also present some of the tools and databases that are linked to each entry.},

Recent studies have firmly established pigment dispersing factor (PDF), a C-terminally amidated octodecapeptide, as a key neurotransmitter regulating rhythmic circadian locomotory behaviours in adult Drosophila melanogaster. The mechanisms by which PDF functions as a circadian peptide transmitter are not fully understood, however; in particular, nothing is known about the role of extracellular peptidases in terminating PDF signalling at synapses. In this study we show that PDF is susceptible to hydrolysis by neprilysin, an endopeptidase that is enriched in synaptic membranes of mammals and insects. Neprilysin cleaves PDF at the internal Ser7–Leu8 peptide bond to generate PDF1-7 and PDF8-18. Neither of these fragments were able to increase intracellular cAMP levels in HEK293 cells cotransfected with the Drosophila PDF receptor cDNA and a firefly luciferase reporter gene, confirming that such cleavage results in PDF inactivation. The Ser7–Leu8 peptide bond was also the principal cleavage site when PDF was incubated with membranes prepared from heads of adult Drosophila. This endopeptidase activity was inhibited by the neprilysin inhibitors phosphoramidon (IC50, 0.15 μmol l–1) and thiorphan (IC50, 1.2 μmol l–1). We propose that cleavage by a member of the Drosophila neprilysin family of endopeptidases is the most likely mechanism for inactivating synaptic PDF and that neprilysin might have an important role in regulating PDF signals within circadian neural circuits.},

	abstract = {Prohormone convertases (PCs) are calcium-dependent serine endoproteases of the subtilisin family that play a key role in the posttranslational processing of precursors for bioactive peptides. In this study, the cDNA of PC1 from abalone (Haliotis diversicolor supertexta) was cloned and sequenced. The PC1 cDNA consisted of 2216bp with an open reading frame of 2010bp encoding a 670 amino acid peptide. Comparative structural analysis revealed that abalone PC1 shared high similarity and identity with most PC counterparts. The profile of deduced peptide of PC1 was composed of an N-terminal signal peptide, a prosegment domain, a catalytic domain and a P domain, which were common in many species. Sequence analysis indicated that the abalone PC1 was highly conserved in catalytic domain, including three conserved serine catalytic signatures that comprised a catalytic triad active center. Also conserved were the potential cleavage site for release of the mature peptide, a cognate integrin binding site RGD in P domain, and four cysteine residues involved in forming an intrachain disulfide bridge. To further investigate the functions of PC1 in abalone, real-time quantitative PCR was performed to determine the expression level of this gene at three different reproduction stages (i.e. pre-, during- and post-breeding). Results indicated that PC1 was expressed throughout the three stages but the expression levels varied with the timepoints and different tissues in abalone. The expression levels of PC1 in digestive gland were much higher than those of the gonad. In female abalone, the expression of PC1 was higher at pre-breeding and during-breeding stages (P{\textless}0.05), and the expression declined at the subsequent stage. Whereas, the level of PC1 in male individual did not exhibit a significant difference in various reproduction stages. Also, the natural enzyme activity of PC1 partially exhibited a similar tendency with the mRNA expression. According to the results, it can be concluded that PC1 gene is involved in the abalone reproduction process (e.g. spawning or sperming). PC1 is a potential prohormone processing enzyme and it may play a critical role in abalone physiological processes related to reproduction.},

The mRNAs of three subunits of PmPP2A were expressed constitutively in all tissues examined, and predominantly in the ovaries. In ovarian maturation stages, the three subunits of PmPP2A were continuously but differentially expressed. Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine injection experiments were conducted to study the expression profile of three subunits of PmPP2A, and the results indicated that PmPP2A played a negative regulatory role in the process of ovarian maturation.

To reveal the critical phosphatases that dephosphorylate INAD, we used several biochemical analyses and identified protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) as a candidate. Importantly, the catalytic subunit of PP2A, microtubule star (MTS), is copurified with INAD, and an elevated phosphorylation of INAD by eye-PKC was observed in three mts heterozygotes. To explore whether PP2A (MTS) regulates dephosphorylation of INAD by counteracting eye-PKC [INAC (inactivation no afterpotential C] in vivo, we performed ERG recordings. We discovered that inaCP209 was semidominant, because inaCP209 heterozygotes displayed abnormal light adaptation and slow deactivation. Interestingly, the deactivation defect of inaCP209 heterozygotes was rescued by the mtsXE2258 heterozygous background. In contrast, mtsXE2258 failed to modify the severe deactivation of norpAP16, indicating that MTS does not modulate NORPA (no receptor potential A) (PLCβ). Together, our results strongly indicate that dephosphorylation of INAD is catalyzed by PP2A, and a reduction of PP2A can compensate for a partial loss of function in eye-PKC, restoring the fast deactivation kinetics in vivo. We thus propose that the fast deactivation of the visual response is modulated in part by the phosphorylation of INAD.},

Individual cells within the eye are exposed to many extracellular signals, express multiple surface receptors, and make use of a large complement of cell-subtype-specific DNA-binding transcription factors. Despite this enormous complexity, each cell will make the correct developmental choice and adopt the appropriate cell fate. How this process is managed remains a poorly understood paradigm. Members of the CREB binding protein (CBP)/p300 family have been shown to influence development by (1) acting as bridging molecules between the basal transcriptional machinery and specific DNA-binding transcription factors, (2) physically interacting with terminal members of signaling cascades, (3) acting as transcriptional coactivators of downstream target genes, and (4) playing a key role in chromatin remodeling. In a screen for new genes involved in eye development we have identified the Drosophila homolog of CBP as a key player in both eye specification and cell fate determination.

	abstract = {Adipokines secreted from adipose tissue are key regulators of metabolism in animals. Adiponectin, one of the adipokines, modulates pancreatic beta cell function to maintain energy homeostasis. Recently, significant conservation between Drosophila melanogaster and mammalian metabolism has been discovered. Drosophila insulin like peptides (Dilps) regulate energy metabolism similarly to mammalian insulin. However, in Drosophila, the regulatory mechanism of insulin producing cells (IPCs) by adipokine signaling is largely unknown. Here, we describe the discovery of the Drosophila adiponectin receptor and its function in IPCs. Drosophila adiponectin receptor (dAdipoR) has high homology with the human adiponectin receptor 1. The dAdipoR antibody staining revealed that dAdipoR was expressed in IPCs of larval and adult brains. IPC- specific dAdipoR inhibition (Dilp2{\textgreater}dAdipoR-Ri) showed the increased sugar level in the hemolymph and the elevated triglyceride level in whole body. Dilps mRNA levels in the Dilp2{\textgreater}dAdipoR-Ri flies were similar with those of controls. However, in the Dilp2{\textgreater}dAdipoR-Ri flies, Dilp2 protein was accumulated in IPCs, the level of circulating Dilp2 was decreased, and insulin signaling was reduced in the fat body. In ex vivo fly brain culture with the human adiponectin, Dilp2 was secreted from IPCs. These results indicate that adiponectin receptor in insulin producing cells regulates insulin secretion and controls glucose and lipid metabolism in Drosophila melanogaster. This study demonstrates a new adipokine signaling in Drosophila and provides insights for the mammalian adiponectin receptor function in pancreatic beta cells, which could be useful for therapeutic application.},

	abstract = {Adiponectin (AdipoQ) and its receptors (AdipoRs) are strongly related to growth and development of skeletal muscle, as well as glucose and lipid metabolism in vertebrates. Herein we report the identification of the first full-length cDNA encoding an AdipoR homolog (Liv-AdipoR) from the decapod crustacean Litopenaeus vannamei using a combination of next generation sequencing (NGS) technology and bioinformatics analysis. The full-length Liv-AdipoR (1,245 bp) encoded a protein that exhibited the canonical seven transmembrane domains (7TMs) and the inversed topology that characterize members of the progestin and adipoQ receptor (PAQR) family. Based on the obtained sequence information, only a single orthologous AdipoR gene appears to exist in arthropods, whereas two paralogs, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, have evolved in vertebrates. Transcriptional analysis suggested that the single Liv-AdipoR gene appears to serve the functions of two mammalian AdipoRs. At 72 h after injection of 50 pmol Liv-AdipoR dsRNA (340 bp) into L. vannamei thoracic muscle and deep abdominal muscle, transcription levels of Liv-AdipoR decreased by 93\% and 97\%, respectively. This confirmed optimal conditions for RNAi of Liv-AdipoR. Knockdown of Liv-AdipoR resulted in significant changes in the plasma levels of ammonia, 3-methylhistine, and ornithine, but not plasma glucose, suggesting that that Liv-AdipoR is important for maintaining muscle fibers. The chronic effect of Liv-AdipoR dsRNA injection was increased mortality. Transcriptomic analysis showed that 804 contigs were upregulated and 212 contigs were downregulated by the knockdown of Liv-AdipoR in deep abdominal muscle. The significantly upregulated genes were categorized as four main functional groups: RNA-editing and transcriptional regulators, molecular chaperones, metabolic regulators, and channel proteins.},

This paper gives a comprehensive account of the receptor-mediated yolk protein uptake in a lepidopteran insect Spodoptera litura and a decapod crustacean Scylla serrata. The vitellogenin (Vg) of both these arthropods has been characterized using electrophoretic and immuno-blotting techniques. The Vg's of both the animals are glycolipoproteins and exhibit immunological identity with their respective lipovitellins (Lv's). The physico-chemical characterization of vitellogenin receptors (VgR) of these arthropods revealed several similarities in their molecular weight and binding affinity with vitellins, which was increased considerably by divalent cation calcium. On the other hand, their binding affinity decreased significantly when treated with polyanionic suramin. These properties, along with the strong affinity of crab VgR for mammalian LDL and VLDL, qualify them as members of LDLR superfamily. The receptor-mediated endocytotic entry of Vg into the oocytes has been demonstrated by immunogold electron microscopic technique. The pathway starting from the formation of coated pits to the formation of mature endosomes has been traced using antibodies of Vg and VgR and gold-labeled secondary goat antibody. Use of green immunofluorescence techniques with FITC-tagged Vg antibody of S. litura produced additional evidence for endocytotic yolk protein uptake as well as uneven distribution of yolk within the oocytes.},

In crustaceans, PUFAs and prostaglandins have been detected and often associated with female reproductive maturation. However, the presence of prostanoid biosynthesis genes remained in question in these species. In this study, we outlined the prostanoid pathway in the black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon based on the amplification of nine prostanoid biosynthesis genes: cytosolic phospholipase A2, hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase, glutathione-dependent prostaglandin D synthase, prostaglandin E synthase 1, prostaglandin E synthase 2, prostaglandin E synthase 3, prostaglandin F synthase, thromboxane A synthase and cyclooxygenase. TBLASTX analysis confirmed the identities of these genes with 51-99\% sequence identities to their closest homologs. In addition, prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α), which is a product of the prostaglandin F synthase enzyme, was detected for the first time in P. monodon ovaries along with the previously identified PUFAs and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) using RP-HPLC and mass-spectrometry. The prostaglandin synthase activity was also observed in shrimp ovary homogenates using in vitro activity assay. When prostaglandin biosynthesis was examined in different stages of shrimp ovaries, we found that the amounts of prostaglandin F synthase gene transcripts and PGF2α decreased as the ovaries matured. These findings not only indicate the presence of a functional prostanoid pathway in penaeid shrimp, but also suggest a possible role of the PGF2α biosynthesis in shrimp ovarian development.},

Understanding its metabolic pathway is a key for various potential applications in crustacean aquaculture, including artificial seed production and enhancement of growth. Although the synthetic pathway of MF is well established, little is known about its degradation and recycling in crustaceans. In insects, juvenile hormone esterase (JHE), a carboxylesterase, is responsible for JH inactivation. Two cDNAs, encoding JHE-like carboxylesterases (CXEs) from the hepatopancreas and ovary of Pandalopsis japonica, were isolated by using a combination of in-silico data mining from an expressed sequence tag (EST) database and traditional PCR-based cloning. The full length Pj-CXE1 (2084bp) and Pj-CXE2 (1985bp) cDNAs encoded proteins composed of 584 and 581 amino acids, respectively. The active site sequence and domain organization of the Pj-CXEs were highly conserved, including the catalytic triad and other motifs, which suggested that both Pj-CXEs are biologically active carboxylesterases. Phylogenetic analysis of the deduced sequences of Pj-CXEs showed that both were most closely related to the JHEs from non-lepidopteran insects. End-point RT-PCR showed that Pj-CXE1 was expressed primarily in the gonad, whereas Pj-CXE2 was expressed in both the hepatopancreas and hindgut. Quantitative PCR showed that Pj-CXE1 was upregulated in the gonads by eyestalk ablation (ESA). In contrast, ESA had no significant effect on Pj-CXE2 expression in hepatopancreas or gonad. This is the first report of the cloning of two JHE-like CXE cDNAs in decapods and the upregulation of Pj-CXE1 by acute withdrawal of eyestalk neuropeptides. Further study is needed to understand the function of CXEs in MF metabolism and its regulation by eyestalk neuropeptides.},

A cDNA clone coding for a sea urchin embryonic protein was isolated from a prehatching blastula lambda gt11 library. The predicted translation product is a secreted 64 × 10(3) Mr enzyme designated as BP10. The protein contains several domains: a signal peptide, a putative propeptide, a catalytic domain with an active center typical of a Zn(2+)-metalloprotease, an EGF-like domain and two internal repeats similar to repeated domains found in the C1s and C1r serine proteases of the complement cascade. The BP10 protease is constructed with the same domains as the human bone morphogenetic protein BMP-1, a protease described as a factor involved in bone formation, and as the recently characterized product of the tolloid gene which is required for correct dorsal-ventral patterning of the Drosophila embryo. The transcription of the BP10 gene is transiently activated around the 16- to 32-cell stage and the accumulation of BP10 transcripts is limited to a short period at the blastula stage. By in situ hybridization with digoxygenin-labelled RNA probes, the BP10 transcripts were only detected in a limited area of the blastula, showing that the transcription of the BP10 gene is also spatially controlled. Antibodies directed against a fusion protein were used to detect the BP10 protein in embryonic extracts. The protein is first detected in early blastula stages, its level peaks in late cleavage, declines abruptly before ingression of primary mesenchyme cells and remains constant in late development. The distribution of the BP10 protein during its synthesis and secretion was analysed by immunostaining blastula-stage embryos. The intracellular localization of the BP10 staining varies with time. The protein is first detected in a perinuclear region, then in an apical and submembranous position just before its secretion into the perivitelline space. The protein is synthesized in a sharply delimited continuous territory spanning about 70\% of the blastula. Comparison of the size and orientation of the labelled territory in the late blastula with the fate map of the blastula stage embryo shows that the domain in which the BP10 gene is expressed corresponds to the presumptive ectoderm. Developing embryos treated with purified antibodies against the BP10 protein and with synthetic peptides derived from the EGF-like domain displayed perturbations in morphogenesis and were radialized to various degrees. These results are consistent with a role for BP10 in the differentiation of ectodermal lineages and subsequent patterning of the embryo. On the basis of these results, we speculate that the role of BP10 in the sea urchin embryo might be similar to that of tolloid in Drosophila. We discuss the idea that the processes of spatial regulation of gene expression along the animal-vegetal in sea urchin and dorsal-ventral axes in Drosophila might have some similarities and might use common elements.},

So far, heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans have been highlighted as a low affinity receptor for morphogens containing Wnts. Here we show the importance of chondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycans in the efficient signaling of Wnt-3a and the structural features of CS required for the regulation of Wnt-3a signaling. Wnt-3a signaling was depressed in a mouse L cell mutant, called sog9, which is defective in the EXT1 gene encoding the HS-synthesizing enzyme and the chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferase (C4ST-1) gene compared with parental L cells. The transfection of sog9 cells with C4ST-1 resulted in the recovery of Wnt-3a signaling, whereas the expression of EXT1 in sog9 cells could not restore Wnt-3a signaling. In addition, the expression level of introduced C4ST-1 correlated with the recovery of Wnt-3a signaling accompanied by the increased expression of the E disaccharide unit of CS. Interestingly, molecular interaction analyses using Biacore revealed that squid CS-E (rich in the E disaccharide unit) bound strongly to Wnt-3a (Kd = 13.2 nm) to the same extent as heparin from bovine lung (Kd = 8.43 nm). In contrast, other CS isoforms as well as HS isolated from bovine kidney showed little binding activity to Wnt-3a. Moreover, exogenously added CS-E potently inhibited the accumulation of β-catenin induced by Wnt-3a. These results suggest that CS-E-like structures synthesized by C4ST-1 participate in Wnt-3a signaling and modulate the physiological events caused by Wnt-3a signals.},

Two kinds of phenoloxidases, laccase and tyrosinase, have been proposed to participate in tanning, but proof of the true identity of the enzyme(s) responsible for this process has been elusive. We report the cloning of cDNAs for laccases and tyrosinases from the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, as well as their developmental patterns of expression. To test for the involvement of these types of enzymes in cuticle tanning, we performed RNA interference experiments to decrease the levels of individual phenoloxidases. Normal phenotypes were obtained after dsRNA-mediated transcript depletion for all phenoloxidases tested, with the exception of laccase 2. Insects injected with dsRNA for the laccase 2 gene failed to tan, were soft-bodied and deformed, and subsequently died in a dsRNA dose-dependent fashion. The results presented here support the hypothesis that two isoforms of laccase 2 generated by alternative splicing catalyze larval, pupal, and adult cuticle tanning in Tribolium.},

	abstract = {Juvenile hormone (JH) prevents insect larval metamorphosis and stimulates processes for adult reproduction. Krüppel-homolog 1 (Kr-h1), a zinc finger transcription factor, is shown to mediate the anti-metamorphic effect of JH in both holometabolous and hemimetabolous insects. However, the role of Kr-h1 in JH-mediated reproduction has not been determined. Using the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria, we showed here that Kr-h1 was expressed in response to JH in female adults, and Kr-h1 transcription was directly regulated by the JH-receptor complex comprised of Methoprene-tolerant (Met) and steroid receptor co-activator. We demonstrated that Kr-h1 RNAi phenocopied Met RNAi and JH-deprived condition during post-eclosion development and vitellogenesis of female locusts. Knockdown of Kr-h1 resulted in substantial reduction of Vg expression in the fat body and lipid accumulation in the primary oocytes, accompanied by blocked follicular epithelium development, oocyte maturation and ovarian growth. Our data therefore reveal a crucial role of Kr-h1 in insect vitellogenesis and egg production. This study suggests that JH-Met-Kr-h1 signaling pathway is also functional in insect reproduction.},

	abstract = {In vertebrates, adipose tissue stores energy in the form of fat. Fat storage is tightly controlled by and dynamically balanced with energy expenditure under physiological settings; the perturbation of fat in either excess (obese) or deficit (lipodystrophy) has devastating pathologic consequences in the fueling of homeostasis and organismal fitness. The process by which fat storage is coordinated through positive and negative feedback signals is still poorly understood. To address potential mechanisms underlying fat storage we study a Caenorhabditis elegans Krüppel-like transcription factor, Ce-klf-3 and demonstrate that klf-3 is a hitherto unrecognized key regulator of fat metabolism in C. elegans. The Ce-klf-3 is highly expressed during larval development and predominantly present in intestine: the site of fat digestion, absorption, storage, and utilization. We found a strong positive correlation between klf-3 expression and fat deposition in a worm's intestine. Significantly, a klf-3 (ok1975) loss-of-function mutation, characterized by the deletion of a 1658-bp sequence spanning the 3′ end of exon 2 through to the 5′ end of exon 3 of klf-3, enhanced fat deposition in the intestine and caused severe defects in worm reproduction. Although klf-3 mutants seemed very similar to wild type worms in appearance and life span, 70\% of mutants became semi-sterile, each producing 40–50 viable progenies, and the remaining 30\% were rendered completely sterile toward adulthood. Notably, both mutant types displayed extensive deposition of fat in the intestine. Our study also demonstrates that klf-3 is critical for maintaining normal fatty acid composition by regulating genes involved in a fatty acid desaturation pathway. Strikingly, klf-3 mutant animals with impaired fatty acid β-oxidation pathway genes resulted in fat accumulation in the mutant worm. We present the first clear in vivo evidence supporting essential regulatory roles of KLF-3 in fat storage in C. elegans and shed light on the human equivalent in disease–gene association.},

	abstract = {Temperate insects have evolved diapause, a period of programmed developmental arrest during specific life stages, to survive unfavourable conditions. During the diapause preparation phase (DPP), diapause-destined individuals generally store large amounts of fat by regulating nutrition distribution for the energy requirement during diapause maintenance and postdiapause development. Although nutritional patterns during the DPP have been investigated at physiological and biochemical levels in many insects, it remains largely unknown how nutritional metabolism is regulated during the DPP at molecular levels. We used RNA sequencing to compare gene expression profiles of adult female cabbage beetles Colaphellus bowringi during the preoviposition phase (POP) and the DPP. Most differentially expressed genes were involved in specific metabolic pathways during the DPP. Genes related to lipid and carbohydrate metabolic pathways were clearly highly expressed during the DPP, whereas genes related to protein metabolic pathways were highly expressed during the POP. Hormone challenge and RNA interference experiments revealed that juvenile hormone via its nuclear receptor methoprene-tolerant mediated the expression of genes associated with nutritional metabolism during the DPP. This work not only sheds light on the mechanisms of diapause preparation, but also provides new insights into the molecular basis of environmental plasticity in insects.},

	abstract = {Background Model-based analysis of data from quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is potentially more powerful and versatile than traditional methods. Yet existing model-based approaches cannot properly deal with the higher sampling variances associated with low-abundant targets, nor do they provide a natural way to incorporate assumptions about the stability of control genes directly into the model-fitting process. Results In our method, raw qPCR data are represented as molecule counts, and described using generalized linear mixed models under Poisson-lognormal error. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is used to sample from the joint posterior distribution over all model parameters, thereby estimating the effects of all experimental factors on the expression of every gene. The Poisson-based model allows for the correct specification of the mean-variance relationship of the PCR amplification process, and can also glean information from instances of no amplification (zero counts). Our method is very flexible with respect to control genes: any prior knowledge about the expected degree of their stability can be directly incorporated into the model. Yet the method provides sensible answers without such assumptions, or even in the complete absence of control genes. We also present a natural Bayesian analogue of the “classic” analysis, which uses standard data pre-processing steps (logarithmic transformation and multi-gene normalization) but estimates all gene expression changes jointly within a single model. The new methods are considerably more flexible and powerful than the standard delta-delta Ct analysis based on pairwise t-tests. Conclusions Our methodology expands the applicability of the relative-quantification analysis protocol all the way to the lowest-abundance targets, and provides a novel opportunity to analyze qRT-PCR data without making any assumptions concerning target stability. These procedures have been implemented as the MCMC.qpcr package in R.},

	abstract = {Salps swim by means of rhythmic contractions of the circular body muscles. In most species, these contractions are regular. At constant temperature, the pulsation rate is inversely related to body length for hand-collected animals. Such a relationship is not seen with trawl-collected salps. When temperature is lowered experimentally, marked differences are seen in the response of individual species. The pulsation rates of Pegea confederata, Cyclosalpa polae, and Salpa cylindrica are greatly depressed and cease altogether at low temperatures (response type I). For Pegea socia, Cyclosalpa pinnata, Cyclosalpa affinis, and Salpa maxima, the pulsation rates are usually greatly depressed, but do not cease, even at extremely low temperatures (response type II). The pulsation rates of Salpa fusiformis and Salpa aspera are largely insensitive to changes in temperature (response type III). Evidence from net sampling suggests a relationship between these response types and vertical and horizontal distribution patterns. Salps showing response type I are found only in tropical and subtropical surface waters; those showing response type II are more widely distributed or are found in temperate waters; and those showing response type III are vertical migrators. Thus, differences in the temperature response provide clues as to the differing modes of life available to salps in the open sea.},

This study introduces nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number ratios as a metric with which to screen for this functional genetic variation prior to more extensive omics analyses. To illustrate the metric, quantitative PCR was used to estimate nrDNA (18S) to mtDNA (16S) copy number ratios in muscle tissue from samples of two zooplankton species: Salpa thompsoni caught near Elephant Island (Southern Ocean) and S. fusiformis sampled off Gough Island (South Atlantic). Average 18S:16S ratios in these samples were 9:1 and 3:1, respectively. nrDNA 45S arrays and mitochondrial genomes were then deep sequenced to uncover the sources of intra-individual genetic variation underlying these 18S:16S copy number differences. The deep sequencing profiles obtained were consistent with genetic changes resulting from adaptive processes, including an expansion of nrDNA and damage to mtDNA in S. thompsoni, potentially in response to the polar environment. Beyond this example from zooplankton, nrDNA:mtDNA copy number ratios offer a promising metric to help identify genetic variation of functional relevance in animals more broadly.},

Among marine organisms, zooplankton play a crucial role in the marine ecosystem and therefore understanding the effects of crude oil chronic exposure on zooplankton is needed to determine the impact of oil in marine environments. The present study reports on the effect of crude oil on adult northern krill, Meganyctiphanes norvegica, collected during three seasons. Their sensitivity to oil was examined with oil concentration of 0.01 versus 0.1mgoilL−1 and photo-modified oil in flowing seawater maintained in the dark for 2weeks at in situ temperature. Oil (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs) entered the krill (on average, 350 and 4400μg·kg−1 wet weight in low and medium oil treatments respectively) and a larger fraction of the krill exhibited digestive gland pathologies (enhanced apoptosis and pathology of digestive tubules) in oil treatments (27–80\%) compared to a significantly lower fraction (7–13\%) in treatments that received no oil. However, 2-week oil exposure at these concentrations did not significantly decrease survivorship or impair basic functioning such as feeding and respiration rates. Similarly, there were only limited changes in the transcription of 7 selected genes from head tissue. Additionally, although there was significant seasonal variation in krill total lipid content and fatty acid composition, there was no treatment effect on both these parameters, which suggests limited oxidative stress under experimental conditions. Furthermore, there was no significant treatment effect on two direct measures of oxidative stress (MDA: malondialdehyde and AOPP: advanced oxidation protein products) in any of the seasons. Nevertheless, histology clearly revealed enhanced digestive gland pathologies in krill even at low concentrations. Although krill with such pathologies continue to survive, their accumulation of PAHs may be transferred up the food chain, impacting their predators and the wider ecosystem.},

In recent decades, salp populations shifted significantly southward intruding into areas generally dominated by Antarctic krill. It is unclear whether salps can survive in high latitude waters because of their hypothesized negative reproductive response to low temperatures and scarcity of food. To explore how environmental conditions impact S. thompsoni reproductive fitness, we examined a long-term (1993–2013), cross-latitudinal dataset of S. thompsoni population demographics in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Observations cover over 25° of latitude, from just south of the Subtropical Convergence to the Antarctic continent. S. thompsoni populations were strongly driven by temperature with higher abundances observed at temperatures between 3°C and 5°C. Occasionally, dense and mature populations of S. thompsoni occurred at high latitudes during summer, declining in density by autumn, which was accompanied by significant increases in the appearance of failed embryos. The proportion of failed embryos was significantly correlated with decreasing temperature and Chl a, indicating the importance of these parameters in autumn and high latitude population collapses. The successful development and release of an embryo is a critical factor determining the persistence of S. thompsoni populations. Blastozooid bud release occurred continuously from spring to autumn, and may be a way S. thompsoni populations mitigate against the sensitivity of the blastozooid's reproductive fitness to high-Antarctic conditions.},

	abstract = {Salpa thompsoni is an important grazer in the Southern Ocean. It is found from the Subtropical Convergence southward to the coastal Antarctic Seas but being most abundant in the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone. Low temperatures appear to negatively affect their development, limiting their ability to occur in the krill dominated high Antarctic ecosystems. Yet reports indicate that with ocean warming S. thompsoni have experienced a southward shift in their distribution. As they are efficient filter feeders, this shift can result in large-scale changes in the Southern Ocean ecosystem by increasing competitive or predatory interactions with Antarctic krill. To explore salp bloom dynamics in the Southern Ocean a size-structured S. thompsoni population model was developed with growth, consumption, reproduction and mortality rates dependent on temperature and chlorophyll a conditions. The largest uncertainties in S. thompsoni population ecology are individual and population growth rates, with a recent study identifying the possibility that the life cycle could be much shorter than previously considered. Here we run a suite of hypothesis scenarios under various environmental conditions to determine the most appropriate growth rate. Temperature and chlorophyll a were sufficient drivers to recreate seasonal and interannual dynamics of salp populations at two locations. The most suitable growth model suggests that mean S. thompsoni growth rates are likely to be ∼1 mm body length d−1, 2-fold higher than previous calculations. S. thompsoni biomass was dependent on bud release time, with larger biomass years corresponding to bud release occurring during favorable environmental conditions; increasing the survival and growth of blastozooids and resulting in higher embryo release. This model confirms that it is necessary for growth and reproductive rates to be flexible in order for the salp population to adapt to varying environmental conditions and provides a framework that can examine how future salp populations might respond to climate change.},

Placental malformation was already found by the mid-gestation-stage mutant placenta, with poor vascular endothelial cell proliferation in the chorionic plate region and increased apoptotic cell death in the labyrinth.

In the present study, a RACK1 (designed as EsRACK1) gene from Chinese mitten crab E. sinensis was cloned by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique. The full-length cDNA sequence of EsRACK1 was of 1117 bp with an open reading frame (ORF) of 957 bp encoding a polypeptide of 318 amino acids containing seven WD repeats. EsRACK1 shared 62\%–99\% similarities with previously identified RACK1s in amino acid sequence, and it was clustered with the RACK1 from Pacifastacus leniusculus in the phylogenetic tree. The mRNA transcripts of EsRACK1 were constitutively expressed in various tissues with the highest expression level in hepatopancreas. The expression of EsRACK1 mRNA in hemocytes were significantly up-regulated post the stimulations with Vibrio anguillarum and Pichia pastoris. After exposure to CdCl2 and pentachlorophenol, the transcripts of EsRACK1 in hemocytes were up-regulated at the late phase from 12 h. When EsRACK1 was knocked down by dsRNA based RNAi, the total hemocyte counts, new-born hemocytes and phosphorylation of JNK were all significantly decreased. In addition, EsRACK1 transcription and phosphorylation of JNK were both decreased in hematopoietic tissue post Aeromonas hydrophila challenge. All the results suggested that EsRACK1 was involved in the innate immune response of the crab and participated in the production of new-born hemocytes through activation of JNK.},

	abstract = {There are increasing concerns over potential long-term changes in krill distribution and abundance, determining whether such changes are related to climate change and/or harvesting and how they might be distinguished from multi-scale variability. With nearly a century of observations on krill distribution, the general patterns of occurrence were determined over 50 years ago, however the last decade has seen an important consolidation of details of seasonal and inter-annual distributions, although some potentially important krill habitats such as the Bellingshausen, Amundsen and Ross Seas are still poorly sampled. Moreover the unexplored perennial multi-year pack-ice regions still await survey by remote under-ice samplers. Krill consistently occur in the upper 200 m of the ocean but various recent observations show that a substantial proportion of the population may be found below this pelagic zone. To further understand variability and change there has been a focus on the importance of historic data with the compilation of comprehensive databases, re-analysis of large scale synoptic surveys and the generation of smaller scale time series that now span several decades. In particular the compilation of 90 years of net samples has provided a key resource both in showing changes in large-scale abundance over the last 50 years and together with acoustic data in generating modern estimates of overall krill abundance and biomass. Meanwhile, the increasing availability of ocean circulation models together with remotely sensed data, has enabled the exploration of large-scale teleconnections at both the regional (Scotia Sea) and circum-polar scale and at the seasonal to decadal time scales.},

In Drosophila melanogaster the cyclic expression of per and tim through an autoregulatory feedback loop is believed to play a central role in circadian rhythm generation. However, it is still elusive whether this hypothesis is applicable to other insect species. Here it is shown that per gene plays a key role in the rhythm generation in the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus. Measurement of per mRNA levels in the optic lobe revealed the rhythmic expression of per in light cycles with a peak in the late day to early night, persisting in constant darkness. A single injection of per double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into the abdomen of the final instar nymphs effectively knocked down the mRNA levels as adult to about 50\% of control animals. Most of the per dsRNA-injected crickets completely lost the circadian locomotor activity rhythm in constant darkness up to 50 days after the injection, whereas those injected with DsRed2 dsRNA as a negative control clearly maintained it. The electrical activity of optic lobe efferents also became arrhythmic in the per dsRNA-injected crickets. These results not only suggest that per plays an important role in the circadian rhythm generation also in the cricket but also show that RNA interference is a powerful tool to dissect the molecular machinery of the cricket circadian clock.},

	abstract = {Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), a key species in the Southern Ocean, reduce their metabolism as an energy saving mechanism in response to the harsh environmental conditions during the Antarctic winter. Although the adaptive significance of this seasonal metabolic shift seems obvious, the driving factors are still unclear. In particular, it is debated whether the seasonal metabolic cycle is driven by changes in food availability, or if an endogenous timing system entrained by photoperiod might be involved. In this study, we used different long-term photoperiodic simulations to examine the influence of light regime and endogenous rhythmicity on the regulation of krill seasonal metabolic cycle. Krill showed a seasonal cycle of growth characterized by null-to-negative growth rates during autumn-winter and positive growth rates during spring-summer, which was manifested also in constant darkness, indicating strong endogenous regulation. Similar endogenous cycles were observed for the activity of the key-metabolic enzyme malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and for the expression levels of a selection of metabolic-related genes, with higher values in spring-summer and lower values in autumn-winter. On the other side, a seasonal cycle of oxygen consumption was observed only when krill were exposed to simulated seasonal changes in photoperiod, indicating that light-related cues might play a major role in the regulation of krill oxygen consumption. The influence of light-regime on oxygen consumption was minimal during winter, when light-phase duration was below 8 h, and it was maximal during summer, when light-phase duration was above 16 h. Significant upregulation of the krill clock genes clk, cry2, and tim1, as well as of the circadian-related opsins rh1a and rrh, was observed after light-phase duration had started to decrease in early autumn, suggesting the presence of a signaling cascade linking specific seasonal changes in the Antarctic light regime with clock gene activity and the regulation of krill metabolic dormancy over the winter.},

	abstract = {Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) is a PLS regression method with a special binary ‘dummy’ y-variable and it is commonly used for classification purposes and biomarker selection in metabolomics studies. Several statistical approaches are currently in use to validate outcomes of PLS-DA analyses e.g. double cross validation procedures or permutation testing. However, there is a great inconsistency in the optimization and the assessment of performance of PLS-DA models due to many different diagnostic statistics currently employed in metabolomics data analyses. In this paper, properties of four diagnostic statistics of PLS-DA, namely the number of misclassifications (NMC), the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC), Q2 and Discriminant Q2 (DQ2) are discussed. All four diagnostic statistics are used in the optimization and the performance assessment of PLS-DA models of three different-size metabolomics data sets obtained with two different types of analytical platforms and with different levels of known differences between two groups: control and case groups. Statistical significance of obtained PLS-DA models was evaluated with permutation testing. PLS-DA models obtained with NMC and AUROC are more powerful in detecting very small differences between groups than models obtained with Q2 and Discriminant Q2 (DQ2). Reproducibility of obtained PLS-DA models outcomes, models complexity and permutation test distributions are also investigated to explain this phenomenon. DQ2 and Q2 (in contrary to NMC and AUROC) prefer PLS-DA models with lower complexity and require higher number of permutation tests and submodels to accurately estimate statistical significance of the model performance. NMC and AUROC seem more efficient and more reliable diagnostic statistics and should be recommended in two group discrimination metabolomic studies.},

We introduce mixOmics, an R package dedicated to the multivariate analysis of biological data sets with a specific focus on data exploration, dimension reduction and visualisation. By adopting a systems biology approach, the toolkit provides a wide range of methods that statistically integrate several data sets at once to probe relationships between heterogeneous ‘omics data sets.

Its seasonal life cycle involves reproduction and development in surface waters before overwintering in diapause at depth. Although diapause has been studied for more than a century, the factors responsible for the initiation and termination of it are still unclear. Endogenous clocks have been identified as potent tools for photoperiod measurement and seasonal rhythmicity in many terrestrial species, but knowledge of these remains scarce in the marine realm. Focusing on the dominant CV copepodid stage, we sampled a population of C. finmarchicus from a Scottish sea loch to characterize population dynamics, several physiological parameters, and diel and seasonal expression rhythms of 35 genes representing different metabolic pathways, including the circadian clock machinery. This generated a detailed overview of the seasonal cycle of C. finmarchicus including the most extensive field dataset on circadian clock gene expression in a marine species to date. Gene expression patterns revealed distinct gene clusters upregulated at different phases of the copepod's seasonal cycle. While diel clock cycling was restricted to the active spring/summer phase, many clock genes exhibited the highest expression during diapause. Our results provide new insights into diapause on physiological and genetic levels. We suggest that photoperiod, in interaction with internal and external factors (lipid content, temperature, food availability) and the endogenous clock mechanism, plays an important role in the timing of diapause in C. finmarchicus.},

Three types of allatostatins in insects have been isolated: FGLamides, W(X)6Wamides, and PISCFs. All act rapidly and reversibly; however, although these types occur in all groups of insects studied, they act as inhibitors of juvenile hormone production in only some groups. Only the FGLamide-type peptides have been isolated in crustaceans, in which they may function to stimulate production of hormone by the mandibular glands, as occurs in early cockroach embryos.

In crustaceans, transcriptomic/mass spectral studies have identified C-ASTs in the nervous systems of many species; the cellular distributions of these peptides remain unknown. Here, the distribution of C-AST was mapped in the nervous system of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus, the major contributor to the North Atlantic’s zooplanktonic biomass; C-AST-immunopositive neurons were identified in the protocerebrum, in several peripheral ganglia associated with feeding appendages, and in the ganglia controlling the swimming legs, with immunopositive axons present throughout the ventral nerve cord. In addition, axons innervating the dorsal longitudinal and ventral longitudinal muscles of the body wall of the metasome were labeled by the C-AST antibody. While the distribution of C-AST-like immunoreactivity was similar between sexes, several differences were noted, i.e. two pair of somata located at the deutocerebral/tritocerbral border in males and immunopositive fibers that surround the genital opening in females. To place the C-AST-like labeling into context with those of several previously mapped peptides, i.e. A-type allatostatin (A-AST) and tachykinin-related peptide (TRP), we conducted double-labeling studies; the C-AST-like immunopositive neurons appear distinct from those expressing either A-AST or TRP (and through extrapolation, pigment dispersing hormone). Collectively, our data represent the first mapping of C-AST in crustacean neural tissue, show that sex-specific differences in the distribution of C-AST exist in the C. finmarchicus CNS, and suggest that the peptide may be involved in the modulation of both feeding and postural control/locomotion.},

Variable selection on high throughput biological data, such as gene expression or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), becomes inevitable to select relevant information and, therefore, to better characterize diseases or assess genetic structure. There are different ways to perform variable selection in large data sets. Statistical tests are commonly used to identify differentially expressed features for explanatory purposes, whereas Machine Learning wrapper approaches can be used for predictive purposes. In the case of multiple highly correlated variables, another option is to use multivariate exploratory approaches to give more insight into cell biology, biological pathways or complex traits.

Results
A simple extension of a sparse PLS exploratory approach is proposed to perform variable selection in a multiclass classification framework.

Conclusions
sPLS-DA has a classification performance similar to other wrapper or sparse discriminant analysis approaches on public microarray and SNP data sets. More importantly, sPLS-DA is clearly competitive in terms of computational efficiency and superior in terms of interpretability of the results via valuable graphical outputs. sPLS-DA is available in the R package mixOmics, which is dedicated to the analysis of large biological data sets.},

The allatostatins comprise three structurally distinct peptide families that regulate juvenile hormone production by the insect corpora allata. A-type family members contain the C-terminal motif –YXFGLamide and have been found in species from numerous arthropod taxa. Members of the B-type family exhibit a –WX6Wamide C-terminus and, like the A-type peptides, appear to be broadly conserved within the Arthropoda. By contrast, members of the C-type family, typified by the unblocked C-terminus– PISCF, a pyroglutamine blocked N-terminus, and a disulfide bridge between two internal Cys residues, have only been found in holometabolous insects, i.e. lepidopterans and dipterans. Here, using transcriptomics, we have identified SYWKQCAFNAVSCFamide (disulfide bridging predicted between the two Cys residues), a known honeybee and water flea C-type-like peptide, from the American lobster Homarus americanus (infraorder Astacidea). Using matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization Fourier transform mass spectrometry (MALDI-FTMS), a mass corresponding to that of SYWKQCAFNAVSCFamide was detected in the H. americanus brain, supporting the existence of this peptide and its theorized structure. Furthermore, SYWKQCAFNAVSCFamide was detected by MALDI-FTMS in neural tissues from five additional astacideans as well as 19 members of four other decapod infraorders (i.e. Achelata, Anomura, Brachyura and Thalassinidea), suggesting that it is a broadly conserved decapod peptide. In H. americanus, SYWKQCAFNAVSCFamide is capable of modulating the output of both the pyloric circuit of the stomatogastric nervous system and the heart. This is the first demonstration of bioactivity for this peptide in any species.},

	abstract = {Juvenile hormones (JH), produced by the corpora allata, have an essential role in growth and development, morphogenesis, and reproductive processes of insects. The output of JH and circulating titer are required to be precisely regulated throughout the insect's life in response to developmental requirements and environmental factors. The synthesis of JH must be periodically turned off and on, or finely tuned, in a highly coordinated way. Except for a few key or intensely studied insect species, the control of synthesis of JH by regulatory peptides remains largely undefined and many of the details remain obscure. Several different classes of neuropeptide are believed to be involved in the regulation of corpus allatum function and hence JH output. In different insect species and at different stages of development, these regulatory peptides may include at least three types of inhibitory allatostatins, at least one type of stimulatory allatotropin, and perhaps several other, as yet largely undefined, additional neuropeptides. The details of how each of these peptides acts to affect JH production and their relationship to each other in the coordination of JH synthesis remain to be established. There are several insect orders for which almost nothing is known concerning the regulation of JH synthesis and the peptides that might be involved. Current proteomic and genomic studies are helping to redress this balance but at the same time posing new questions. Other neuropeptides are implicated in the regulation of JH production, and there is new evidence concerning the mode of action of allatotropins.},

	abstract = {Fatty acid synthase (FAS; EC 2.3.1.85) of animal tissues is a complex multifunctional enzyme consisting of two identical monomers. The FAS monomer (∼270 kDa) contains six catalytic activities and from the N-terminus the order is β-ketoacyl synthase (KS), acetyl/malonyl transacylase (AT/MT), β-hydroxyacyl dehydratase (DH), enoyl reductase (ER), β-ketoacyl reductase (KR), acyl carrier protein (ACP), and thioesterase (TE). Although the FAS monomer contains all the activities needed for palmitate synthesis, only the dimer form of the synthase is functional. Both the biochemical analyses and the small-angle neutron-scattering analysis determined that in the dimer form of the enzyme the monomers are arranged in a head-to-tail manner generating two centers for palmitate synthesis. Further, these analyses also suggested that the component activities of the monomer are organized in three domains. Domain I contains KS, AT/MT, and DH, domain II contains ER, KR, and ACP, and domain III contains TE. Approximately one fourth of the monomer protein located between domains I and II contains no catalytic activities and is called the interdomain/core region. This region plays an important role in the dimer formation. Electron cryomicrographic analyses of FAS revealed a quaternary structure at approximately 19 Å resolution, containing two monomers (180×130×75 Å) that are separated by about 19 Å, and arranged in an antiparallel fashion, which is consistent with biochemical and neutron-scattering data. The monomers are connected at the middle by a hinge generating two clefts that may be the two active centers of fatty acid synthesis. Normal mode analysis predicted that the intersubunit hinge region and the intrasubunit hinge located between domains II and III are highly flexible. Analysis of FAS particle images by using a simultaneous multiple model single particle refinement method confirmed that FAS structure exists in various conformational states. Attempts to get higher resolution of the structure are under way.},

These compounds are well known for their important actions in mammalian physiology and disease. Recent work has revealed the presence and biological actions of eicosanoids in insects and many other invertebrate animals. In insects, eicosanoids mediate cellular immunity to microbial and metazoan challenge. Notably, some infectious organisms secrete factors responsible for impairing host insect immune reactions by inhibiting biosynthesis of eicosanoids. Eicosanoids also act in insect reproductive biology, in ion transport physiology, and in fever response to infection as well as in protein exocytosis in tick salivary glands. Aside from ongoing actions in homeostasis, certain eicosanoid actions occur at crucial points in insect life histories, such as during infectious challenge and important events in reproduction.},

	abstract = {The isoprenoid methyl farnesoate (MF) has been implicated in the regulation of crustacean development and reproduction in conjunction with eyestalk molt inhibiting hormones and ecdysteroids. Farnesoic acid O-methyltransferase (FAMeT) catalyzes the methylation of farnesoic acid (FA) to produce MF in the terminal step of MF synthesis. We have previously cloned and characterized the shrimp FAMeT. In the present study, recombinant FAMeT (rFAMeT) was produced for bioassay and antiserum generation. FAMeT is widely distributed in shrimp tissues with the highest concentration observed in the ventral nerve cord. Interestingly, an additional larger protein in the eyestalk also showed immunoreactivity to anti-FAMeT serum. FAMeT was localized in the neurosecretory cells of the X-organ-sinus gland complex of the eyestalk. As shown by RT-PCR, FAMeT mRNA is constitutively expressed throughout the molt cycle in the eyestalk and the ventral nerve cord. To show that our cloned gene product had FAMeT activity, we demonstrated that expressed rFAMeT gene product catalyzed the conversion of FA to MF in a radiochemical assay. The ubiquitous distribution of FAMeT suggests that this enzyme is involved in physiological processes in addition to gametogenesis, oocyte maturation and development and metamorphosis of the shrimp. We hypothesize that FAMeT directly or indirectly (through MF) modulates the reproduction and growth of crustaceans by interacting with the eyestalk neuropeptides as a consequence of its presence in the neurosecretory cells of the X-organ-sinus gland.},

Although a few animals had detectable MF levels in their hemolymph, this compound was undetectable ({\textless}0.4 ng/ml) in the hemolymph of most animals. One day after bilateral eyestalk ablation, MF was detected in the hemolymph of all animals, reaching variable levels (2.0–31.2 ng/ml) by the fourth day. Unilateral eyestalk ablation caused a smaller increase in hemolymph levels of MF. Similarly, the MF content of the MO, the only known site of MF synthesis, was low in intact lobsters (8.1 ng/gland) and was elevated in unilaterally and bilaterally eyestalk-ablated animals (54.1 and 106.9 ng/gland, respectively). When extracts of the sinus gland (SG), a source of neuropeptides in the eyestalk, were injected into bilaterally ablated lobsters, hemolymph levels of MF dropped to undetectable levels in 2 to 3 hr. The response to SG extract was dose dependent, and MF levels recovered by 12 to 24 hr after treatment. SG extract also lowered the MF content in the MO from 267.6 to 6.6 ng/gland after 4 hr. These results indicate that MF in the hemolymph and MO is negatively regulated by a factor(s) from the SG.},

	abstract = {Although many crustacean neuroendocrine hormones have been reported, the enzymes responsible for post-translational modification of neuroendocrine hormones have rarely been characterized. A prohormone convertase 2 (PC2)-like enzyme has been isolated from the optic lobe of the giant tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon and referred as PmPC2. The full length cDNA sequence of PmPC2 has been identified and found to resemble evolutionarily conserved PC2 enzymes of vertebrates and invertebrates. PmPC2 was expressed in all larval developmental stages and in neuroendrocrine cells in the adult optic lobe. Its expression was found to be negatively related with shrimp body weight by qPCR (P{\textless}0.05). Immunohistochemistry results using an anti-rPmPC2 antibody with adult shrimp revealed high staining intensity in specific neurosecretory cells including the sinus gland, the organ of Hanström (also referred to as the medullar terminalis X-organ) and the organ of Bellonci (also referred to as the sensory or X-organ). By using the yeast two hybrid technique, PmPC2 was found to bind with P. monodon hyperglycemic hormone (Pem-CHH1) that plays an important role in glucose metabolism. Since PmPC2 is a subtilisin-like serine proteinase, it is expected to cleave the synthetic substrate, pyr-RTKR-MCA, but the expressed recombinant catalytic domain of PmPC2 (rPmPC2-cat) showed no enzymatic activity as expected. In vivo injection of dsRNA-PmPC2 resulted in reduced transcripts for both PmPC2 and Pem-CHH1 on day 3 post injection, but there was no accompanying reduction of glucose level in the hemolymph. Taken together, PmPC2 localization, expression and activity suggest that it has a function(s) in the shrimp neuroendrocrine system and that it may not only activate Pem-CHH1 but also affect its expression. However, there is no obvious explanation for the negative correlation between PmPC2 expression level and shrimp body weight.},

Expression studies, using in situ hybridization, Northern blots and RNase protection assays, have demonstrated that the mRNAs encoding some of the aforementioned preprohormones (for example, preproPDH and preproCHH) are not only expressed in the eyestalk but also in other parts of the central nervous system. The combination of molecular biological techniques with (bio)chemical and immunochemical methods provides elegant tools to study neuropeptides at the level of mRNA and peptide in individual animals during different physiological conditions.

Crustaceans possess a diverse array of specialized limbs. Although shifts in Hox gene expression domains have been postulated to play a role in generating this limb diversity, little functional data have been provided to understand the precise roles of Hox genes during crustacean development. We used a combination of CRISPR/Cas9-targeted mutagenesis and RNAi knockdown to decipher the function of the six Hox genes expressed in the developing mouth and trunk of the amphipod Parhyale hawaiensis. These experimentally manipulated animals display specific and striking homeotic transformations. We found that abdominal-A (abd-A) and Abdominal-B (Abd-B) are required for proper posterior patterning, with knockout of Abd-B resulting in an animal with thoracic type legs along what would have been an abdomen, and abd-A disruption generating a simplified body plan characterized by a loss of specialization in both abdominal and thoracic appendages. In the thorax, Ubx is necessary for gill development and for repression of gnathal fate, and Antp dictates claw morphology. In the mouth, Scr and Antp confer the part-gnathal, part-thoracic hybrid identity of the maxilliped, and Scr and Dfd prevent antennal identity in posterior head segments. Our results allow us to define the role Hox genes play in specifying each appendage type in Parhyale, including the modular nature by which some appendages are patterned by Hox gene inputs. In addition, we define how changes in Hox gene expression have generated morphological differences between crustacean species. Finally, we also highlight the utility of CRISPR/Cas9-based somatic mutagenesis in emerging model organisms.},

This widespread adoption has been largely fueled by the emergence of the clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) technology, an important new approach for generating RNA-guided nucleases, such as Cas9, with customizable specificities. Genome editing mediated by these nucleases has been used to rapidly, easily and efficiently modify endogenous genes in a wide variety of biomedically important cell types and in organisms that have traditionally been challenging to manipulate genetically. Furthermore, a modified version of the CRISPR-Cas9 system has been developed to recruit heterologous domains that can regulate endogenous gene expression or label specific genomic loci in living cells. Although the genome-wide specificities of CRISPR-Cas9 systems remain to be fully defined, the power of these systems to perform targeted, highly efficient alterations of genome sequence and gene expression will undoubtedly transform biological research and spur the development of novel molecular therapeutics for human disease.},

	abstract = {Analysis of the Strongylocentrotus purpuratus genome has revealed approximately 240 metalloprotease genes, and they represent all 23 families expressed in vertebrates. EST/cDNA sequencing and microarray analysis show that nearly 70\% are represented in embryo RNA. Among them are many metalloproteases with demonstrated developmental roles in other systems-BMP-1/TLD (tolloid) (astacins), MMPs (matrix metalloproteases) and the ADAMs (disintegrin/metalloproteases). The developmental functions of these kinds of metalloproteases include modifying the extracellular matrix, regulating signaling pathways or modulating cellular adhesive properties. The unexpectedly large number of BMP-1/TLD-like protease genes (23) results primarily from expansion of a set encoding an unusual domain conserved in structure and primary sequence only in nematode astacins. Such proteases may have interesting developmental functions because the expression patterns of several are highly regulated along the primary axis at times when cell differentiation and morphogenesis begin. The size of the sea urchin MMP family and the clustered arrangement of many of its members are similar to vertebrates, but phylogenetic analyses suggest that different ancestral genes were independently amplified in sea urchins and vertebrates. One expansion appears to be genes encoding MMPs that have putative transmembrane domains and may be membrane-tethered (MT). Interestingly, the genes encoding TIMPs, inhibitors of MMPs, have also been amplified and the 10 genes are tandemly arranged in a single cluster. In contrast, there are fewer ADAM and ADAMTS genes in sea urchins, but they represent all but one of the chordate-specific groups. The genome sequence now opens the door to experimental manipulations designed to understand how modulation of the extracellular environment affects development.},

Euphausiids play a crucial role in the trophodynamics of the ecosystem, and their status under future environmental scenarios is the subject of much concern. Thysanoessa macrura is the most widely distributed, numerically abundant, and ubiquitous euphausiid south of the Polar Front and may be an underappreciated prey species. T. macrura is eurythermic and may be better able to tolerate warming ocean temperatures in comparison to the more stenothermic Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. We use temperature-dependent growth models and biomass per recruit to investigate how the availability of this euphausiid to predators may change under a range of temperature scenarios. We contrast this with the availability of E. superba and find that, under some ranges of temperature change, increasing T. macrura growth may be able to partially compensate for decreasing E. superba growth in terms of biomass available for predators. However, in spite of its considerable biomass, other aspects of this species, such as its size and habitat, may limit its potential to replace E. superba in the diet of many predators.},

	abstract = {Antarctic krill is a vital part of the food web and supports a significant fishery in the Southern Ocean. Shifts in historical fishing grounds and spatial distribution of catches have occurred as a result of recent changes in fishery practices. To understand these shifts, fishery spatial dynamics and fishing fleet behavior evaluated on different spatial and temporal scales are critical. We examine the catch distribution on three spatial-temporal scales. At the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) scale, we assessed the fleet’s southward expansion, identifying the Bransfield Strait (BS) as the main current fishing ground, replacing the historical Drake sector. At the BS scale, we identified fishing hotspots (FHs) that concentrated 48\%–57\% of the total catch over a period of 2–6 months and had high catch densities (2.2–30.3 ton km−2). At the FH scale, we tracked the spatial distribution of the fleet within FHs, demonstrating a shift of fishing vessels to contiguous zones as a result of a decrease in daily catch rates (CPUE). Such shifts (allowing the fleet to increase CPUE) occurred every 4–17 days. Previously exploited fishing grounds were revisited based on FH persistence and sea ice conditions. This paper concludes with a discussion of the potential impact of fishing fleet behavior and catch concentration, considering the recent spatial shift towards less-exploited areas, the overlap with critical zones for predator feeding, and several implications for fisheries management.},

LFK was prepared by removing exoskeletons from dried whole krill to give a fluoride content of approximately one-fourth of krill meal (KM) at 230 ppm for LFK and 870 ppm for KM. Experimental diets replaced FM with LFK at the replacement proportions of 0.0\%, 7.7\%, 15.4\%, 30.8\%, 46.2\% and 100.0\% (control, LFK7, LFK15, LFK30, LFK46 and LFK100) and were fed to groups of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in duplicate for 95 days in fresh water and growth was observed. In all experimental groups, feed intake, feed efficiency, specific growth rate and hepatosomatic index were unchanged compared with fish fed the control diet (P{\textless}0.05). After 95 days, the fluoride concentration in dorsal muscles of the fish of each experimental group, except LFK100, was below the detectable limit (1 mg/kg), and in vertebral bones it was between 220 mg/kg and 420 mg/kg. However, the dorsal muscle and the vertebral bone of LFK100 contained 1 mg/kg and 1800 mg/kg of fluoride, respectively. Tissue specimens of the liver of each experimental group at 95 days had no histopathological changes. The total replacement of FM from LFK in diets was successful with no defects of growth performances. This study showed that krill protein had a nutritional value equivalent to FM.},

The objective of the study was to determine digestibility, tissue deposition, metabolism, and tissue oxidative stability of the ω-3 PUFAs provided by KPC. Young female Sprague−Dawley rats (n = 10/group) were fed ad libitum isocaloric diets for 4 weeks with either 10\% freeze-dried KPC or 10\% casein. The casein diet contained 5.3\% added corn oil (CO), whereas the KPC contained 5.3\% total lipids from 0.9\% krill oil (KO) provided by KPC and 4.4\% added corn oil (KO + CO). Fatty acid compositions of various tissues were analyzed by gas chromatography. Lipid peroxidation was determined by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Total antioxidant capacity and urinary eicosanoid metabolites were determined by enzyme immunoassay. The ω-3 PUFAs provided in KO from KPC increased (P = 0.003) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) concentration in the brain. DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) content in fat pads and liver were increased (P {\textless} 0.01), whereas the ω-6 PUFA, arachidonic acid (AA), was decreased (P {\textless} 0.01) in rats fed the KPC diet containing the KO + CO mixture compared to rats fed the casein diet containing pure CO. Feeding the KPC diet decreased pro-inflammatory 2-series prostaglandin and thromboxane metabolites. There was no significant difference in TBARS or total antioxidant capacity in the tissues of rats fed the different diets. On the basis of the study results, the low amount of ω-3 PUFAs provided by the KO content of KPC provides beneficial effects of increasing tissue EPA and DHA deposition and reduced AA-derived 2-series eicosanoid metabolites without increasing lipid peroxidation. Therefore, consumption of KPC has the potential to provide a healthy and sustainable source of ω-3 PUFAs.},

	abstract = {Abstract The biogeographic response of oceanic planktonic communities to climatic change has a large influence on the future stability of marine food webs and the functioning of global biogeochemical cycles. Temperature plays a pivotal role in determining the distribution of these communities and ocean warming has the potential to cause major distributional shifts, particularly in polar regions where the thermal envelope is narrow. We considered the impact of long-term ocean warming on the spatial distribution of Southern Ocean mesozooplankton communities through examining plankton abundance in relation to sea surface temperature between two distinct periods, separated by around 60 years. Analyses considered 16 dominant mesozooplankton taxa (in terms of biomass and abundance) in the southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, from net samples and in situ temperature records collected during the Discovery Investigations (1926?1938) and contemporary campaigns (1996?2013). Sea surface temperature was found to have increased significantly by 0.74°C between the two eras. The corresponding sea surface temperature at which community abundance peaked was also significantly higher in contemporary times, by 0.98°C. Spatial projections indicated that the geographical location of community peak abundance had remained the same between the two eras despite the poleward advance of sea surface isotherms. If the community had remained within the same thermal envelope as in the 1920s?1930s, community peak abundance would be 500 km further south in the contemporary era. Studies in the northern hemisphere have found that dominant taxa, such as calanoid copepods, have conserved their thermal niches and tracked surface isotherms polewards. The fact that this has not occurred in the Southern Ocean suggests that other selective pressures, particularly food availability and the properties of underlying water masses, place greater constraints on spatial distributions in this region. It further demonstrates that this community is thermally resilient to present levels of sea surface warming.},

	abstract = {The Southern Ocean (SO) is a major sink for anthropogenic atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), potentially harbouring even greater potential for additional sequestration of CO2 through enhanced phytoplankton productivity. In the SO, primary productivity is primarily driven by bottom up processes (physical and chemical conditions) which are spatially and temporally heterogeneous. Due to a paucity of trace metals (such as iron) and high variability in light, much of the SO is characterised by an ecological paradox of high macronutrient concentrations yet uncharacteristically low chlorophyll concentrations. It is expected that with increased anthropogenic CO2 emissions and the coincident warming, the major physical and chemical process that govern the SO will alter, inﬂuencing the biological capacity and functioning of the ecosystem. This review focuses on the SO primary producers and the bottom up processes that underpin their health and productivity. It looks at the major physico-chemical drivers of change in the SO, and based on current physiological knowledge, explores how these changes will likely manifest in phytoplankton, speciﬁcally, what are the physiological changes and ﬂoristic shifts that are likely to ensue and how this may translate into changes in the carbon sink capacity, net primary productivity and functionality of the SO.},

Phenology as a discipline observes these events and relates their annual variation to variation in climate. But phenology is also studied in other disciplines, each with their own perspective. Evolutionary ecologists study variation in seasonal timing and its fitness consequences, whereas chronobiologists emphasize the periodic nature of life-cycle stages and their underlying timing programmes (e.g. circannual rhythms). The (neuro-) endocrine processes underlying these life-cycle events are studied by physiologists and need to be linked to genes that are explored by molecular geneticists. In order to fully understand variation in phenology, we need to integrate these different perspectives, in particular by combining evolutionary and mechanistic approaches. We use avian research to characterize different perspectives and to highlight integration that has already been achieved. Building on this work, we outline a route towards uniting the different disciplines in a single framework, which may be used to better understand and, more importantly, to forecast climate change impacts on phenology.},

	abstract = {This chapter presents an epigenetic model for the endogenous control of circannual timing. We propose a Dual Compartmentalization Model in which the first compartment is composed of stem/primordial cells and provides the initiation signal for the circannual cycle, and the second compartment is formed of differentiated cells that propagate and amplify the circannual cycle. The model can accommodate transgenerational and developmental variation in circannual rhythms via an epigenetic memory. We apply the model to our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate circannual rhythms in unicellular organisms, plants and the neuroendocrine control of circannual timing in vertebrates. Despite cell-autonomous rhythmicity, in vertebrates there is a hierarchical organisation governed by local brain regions that serves to synchronise rhythmicity in different tissue types and to the environment. The Dual Compartmentalization Model can account for circannual variation in neurogenesis derived from stem cells and may apply in all post-mitotic cells.},

However, the presence of CHH in the central brain, another putative pacemaker of the multi-oscillatory circadian system, of this decapod and its circadian transcription in the optic lobe and brain have yet to be explored. Therefore, using qualitative and quantitative PCR, we isolated and cloned a CHH mRNA fragment from two putative pacemakers of the multi-oscillatory circadian system of Procambarus clarkii, the optic lobe and the central brain. This CHH transcript synchronized to daily light-dark cycles and oscillated under dark, constant conditions demonstrating statistically significant daily and circadian rhythms in both structures. Furthermore, to investigate the presence of the peptide in the central brain of this decapod, we used immunohistochemical methods. Confocal microscopy revealed the presence of CHH-IR in fibers and cells of the protocerebral and tritocerebal clusters and neuropiles, particularly in some neurons located in clusters 6, 14, 15 and 17. The presence of CHH positive neurons in structures of P. clarkii where clock proteins have been reported suggests a relationship between the circadian clockwork and CHH. This work provides new insights into the circadian regulation of CHH, a pleiotropic hormone that regulates many physiological processes such as glucose metabolism and osmoregulatory responses to stress.},

	abstract = {Abstract The study of circadian clocks in crustaceans has led to the hypothesis of a distributed circadian system of pacemakers. In this review, we investigate the role of the crayfish caudal photoreceptor (CPR) as a candidate to form part of this pacemaking circadian system. Two circadian rhythms are documented for CPR electrical activity. These rhythms correspond to the spontaneous and light-induced discharge of action potentials. The intrinsic characterization of the rhythms is made through the analysis of the firing rate of the corresponding action potentials. The discharges were extracellularly recorded in the isolated 6th abdominal ganglion (AG) in an organ culture kept at constant temperature for up to 5 days. For preparations kept in the dark, spontaneous activity varies in a circadian manner, with a period of 24.7 h and the acrophase at subjective nighttime (2140). For light-induced activity, pulses of constant intensity applied regularly throughout the 24-h cycle show that the firing rate at peak and latency vary rhythmically. The period for this rhythm is 24.24 h and the acrophase is at subjective dawn (0326). Additionally, an ultradian rhythm of a ?12-h period was observed for both rhythms. When tested with light pulses of different intensities, the CPR responsiveness at night is almost one log unit greater than in daytime. The effect of temperature on both activities is also described. The phase-shift caused by temperature for these circadian rhythms depends on the application time. These results show that the 6th AG is capable of generating a circadian rhythm of electrical activity in the CPR, which in turn is likely to be part of the crayfish circadian system. A possible interaction of different pacemakers forming the distributed circadian system is also discussed. The role of serotonin as a possible modulator of the CPR electrical activity is documented. In addition, the level of the 5-HT1A receptors displays a diurnal rhythm in the 6th AG, with the acrophase at twilight (1849). We suggest that the 5-HT1A receptor does participate in this modulation. Finally, the hypothesis of the expression of two circadian oscillators in a single identified neuron is presented. Synapse 62:643?652, 2008. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Avian seasonal behaviour, that is, diverse activities associated with reproduction, moult and migration, has an endogenous basis and is ultimately linked to changes in environmental factors such as food supply. However, behaviour occurs in social contexts, and interactions with conspecifics are intimately linked to seasonal activities. Time programmes set the stage for social behaviour, which in turn fine-tunes seasonal activities. We propose that avian schedules are genuinely ‘sociable’: birds communicate seasonal behaviour by both intentional and inadvertent information transfer and negotiate it in competitive and cooperative interactions. Studying the interplay between seasonal and social behaviour can add to our understanding of animal behaviour, including mechanisms by which birds could cope with changing environmental conditions.},

These rhythms are driven by internal molecular oscillators, both entrained by light. Here we provide an overview of our current knowledge on both circadian and circalunar clocks of the worms, as well as their interactions on molecular and behavioral levels.In addition, this chapter also presents new data on the impact of nocturnal light (simulating moonlight) on circadian clock gene expression and locomotor behavior. Consistent with work in other species, nocturnal illumination impacts on both. Circadian clock gene expression profiles of worms at “full moon” (FM, i.e., dim nocturnal light) become arrhythmic. Similarly, worms at “full moon” are equally active during day and night, in contrast to their predominant nocturnality during “new moon” (NM, i.e., dark nights between full moon phases) and “free-running full moon” phases (FR-FM, i.e., dark nights when full moon would be expected). Although circadian clock transcript kinetics are different between FM and FR-FM, the circalunar clock-controlled spawning peaks are indistinguishable. This difference further confirms that circalunar clock function is independent of circadian clock transcript oscillations.},

Winter photoperiods inhibit reproductive neuroendocrine function but cannot sustain this inhibition beyond 6 mo, ensuring vernal reproductive recrudescence. This genomic plasticity suggests a role for epigenetics in the establishment of seasonal reproductive phenotypes. Here, we report that DNA methylation of the proximal promoter for the type III deiodinase (dio3) gene in the hamster hypothalamus is reversible and critical for photoperiodic time measurement. Short photoperiods and winter-like melatonin inhibited hypothalamic DNA methyltransferase expression and reduced dio3 promoter DNA methylation, which up-regulated dio3 expression and induced gonadal regression. Hypermethylation attenuated reproductive responses to short photoperiods. Vernal refractoriness to short photoperiods reestablished summer-like methylation of the dio3 promoter, dio3 expression, and reproductive competence, revealing a dynamic and reversible mechanism of DNA methylation in the mammalian brain that plays a central role in physiological orientation in time.},

	abstract = {Background In diverse taxa, photoperiodic responses that cause seasonal physiological and behavioural shifts are controlled by genes, including the vertebrate Clock orthologues, that encode for circadian oscillator mechanisms. While the genetic network behind circadian rhythms is well described, relatively few reports exist of the phenological consequences of and selection on Clock genes in the wild. Here, we investigated variation in breeding phenology in relation to Clock genetic diversity in a long-distance migratory bird, the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica). Methodology/Principal Findings In a sample of 922 adult barn swallows from a single population breeding in Italy we found one very common (Q7) and three rare (Q5, Q6, Q8) length variants of a functionally significant polyglutamine repeat. Rare (2.9\%) Q7/Q8 heterozygous females, but not males, bred significantly later than common (91.5\%) Q7/Q7 females, consistent with the expectation that ‘long’ alleles cause late breeding, as observed in a resident population of another bird species. Because breeding date depends on arrival date from migration, present results suggest that the association between breeding date and Clock might be mediated by migration phenology. In addition, fecundity selection appears to be operating against Q7/Q8 because late migrating/breeding swallows have fewer clutches per season, and late breeding has additional negative selection effects via reduced offspring longevity. Genotype frequencies varied marginally non-significantly with age, as Q7/Q8 frequency showed a 4-fold reduction in old individuals. This result suggests negative viability selection against Q7/Q8, possibly mediated by costs of late breeding. Conclusions/Significance This is the first study of migratory birds showing an association between breeding phenology and Clock genotype and suggesting that negative selection occurs on a phenologically deviant genotype. Low polymorphism at Clock may constrain microevolutionary phenological response to changing climate, and may thus contribute to the decline of barn swallow populations.},

The Clock gene is a central component of an endogenous circadian clock that senses changes in photoperiod (day length) and mediates seasonal behaviours. Among Pacific salmonids (Oncorhynchus spp.), seasonal timing of migration and breeding is influenced by photoperiod. To expand a study of 42 North American Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations, we tested whether duplicated Clock genes contribute to population differences in reproductive timing. Specifically, we examined geographical variation along a similar latitudinal gradient in the polyglutamine domain (PolyQ) of OtsClock1a and OtsClock1b among 53 populations of three species: chum (Oncorhynchus keta), coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha). We found evidence for variable selection on OtsClock1b that corresponds to latitudinal variation in reproductive timing among these species. We evaluated the contribution of day length and a freshwater migration index to OtsClock1b PolyQ domain variation using regression trees and found that day length at spawning explains much of the variation in OtsClock1b allele frequency among chum and Chinook, but not coho and pink salmon populations. Our findings suggest that OtsClock1b mediates seasonal adaptation and influences geographical variation in reproductive timing in some of these highly migratory species.},

Dormancy regulation has been studied in C. elegans and in several insects, but how neurosensory mechanisms act to relay environmental cues to the endocrine system in order to induce dormancy remains unclear. Here we examine this fundamental question by genetically manipulating aminergic neurotransmitter signaling in Drosophila melanogaster. We find that both serotonin and dopamine enhance adult ovarian dormancy, while the downregulation of their respective signaling pathways in endocrine cells or tissues (insulin producing cells, fat body, corpus allatum) reduces dormancy. In contrast, octopamine signaling antagonizes dormancy. Our findings enhance our understanding of the ability of organisms to cope with unfavorable environments and illuminate some of the relevant signaling pathways.},

	abstract = {Diapause is an actively induced dormancy that has evolved in Metazoa to resist environmental stresses. In temperate regions, many diapausing insects overwinter at low temperatures by blocking embryonic, larval or adult development. Despite its Afro-tropical origin, Drosophila melanogaster migrated to temperate regions of Asia and Europe where females overwinter as adults by arresting gonadal development (reproductive diapause) at temperatures {\textless}13°C. Recent work in D. melanogaster has implicated the developmental hormones dILPs-2 and/or dILP3, and dILP5, homologues of vertebrate insulin/insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), in reproductive arrest. However, polymorphisms in timeless (tim) and couch potato (cpo) dramatically affect diapause inducibility and these dILP experiments could not exclude this common genetic variation contributing to the diapause phenotype. Here, we apply an extensive genetic dissection of the insulin signaling pathway which allows us to see both enhancements and reductions in egg development that are independent of tim and cpo variations. We show that a number of manipulations dramatically enhance diapause to {\textasciitilde}100\%. These include ablating, or reducing the excitability of the insulin-producing cells (IPCs) that express dILPs-2,3,5 employing the dilp2,3,5-/- triple mutant, desensitizing insulin signaling using a chico mutation, or inhibiting dILP2 and 5 in the hemolymph by over-expressing Imaginal Morphogenesis Protein-Late 2 (Imp-L2). In addition, triple mutant dilp2,3,5-/- females maintain high levels of diapause even when temperatures are raised in adulthood to 19°C. However at 22°C, these females all show egg development revealing that the effects are conditional on temperature and not a general female sterility. In contrast, over-expression of dilps-2/5 or enhancing IPC excitability, led to levels of ovarian arrest that approached zero, underscoring dILPs-2 and 5 as key antagonists of diapause.},

We report patch-clamp recordings from intact isolated photoreceptors of wt and mutant flies lacking TRP (trp343), TRPL (trpl302), or both channels (trp313; trpl302). Unitary currents were activated by light in rhabdomere-attached patches. In excised rhabdomeral patches, the channels were directly activated by molecules implicated in phototransduction, such as diacylglycerol and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Currents recorded from trpl photoreceptors are blocked by external Ca2+, Mg2+ (1 mM), and La3+ (20 μM), whereas those from trp photoreceptors are not. Rhabdomeric patches lacked voltage-dependent activity. Patches from trp;trpl mutants were devoid of channels. These characteristics match the macroscopic conductances, suggesting that the unitary currents from Drosophila trpl and trp photoreceptors correspond to TRP and TRPL.},

	abstract = {The honeybee, Apis mellifera, has been used as a model to study the development of the visual system and adult bee behaviour. However, the regulation of the levels of visual component genes has never been addressed in this organism. We isolated honeybee cDNAs encoding green-sensitive opsin and visual arrestin and then measured their mRNA levels in honeybee workers. Both mRNAs fluctuate on a daily cycle that depends on a pacemaker that functions separately from the pacemaker which controls rhythmic locomotor activity. The cycling-patterns of opsin and arrestin mRNAs are different from each other and are modified by light. Furthermore, light exposure can increase the absolute levels of both mRNAs and the arrestin mRNA level is also dependent on age. Consistent with these results, both mRNA levels are higher in foragers than in in-hive bees under natural conditions. This study thus shows that the expression of genes encoding visual components is regulated by multiple factors and is adjusted to the honeybees' need for vision during the day, and throughout their lives. Comparison of data obtained with honeybees and other organisms indicates that there is a link between the regulation of phototransduction components and vision-related animal behaviour.},

concomitant rhythmic changes in the levels of mRNAs that
encode proteins involved in the photoresponse. These changes
may be circadian and independent of light, independent
of circadian clocks and regulated by light, or regulated
by a circadian clock and light. We have taken advantage
of the organization of the Limulus visual system
to examine the separate and combined effects of signals
from a circadian clock and light on arrestin mRNA levels
in photoreceptors. The clock that regulates photoreceptors
in the lateral eye of Limulus is in the brain,
and signals from the clock reach the lateral eye via
activation of a well-characterized efferent projection
in the lateral optic nerve. In the experiments described,
clock-driven efferent input to the lateral eye was eliminated
by cutting the lateral optic nerve, and light input to
the lateral eye was eliminated by placing an opaque patch
over the eye. Arrestin mRNA levels were quantified relative
to 18s rRNA with a ribonuclease protection assay. We observed
the following. In lateral eyes exposed to natural diurnal
light and endogenous efferent nerve activity, the level
of arrestin mRNA was higher during the day in the light
than during the night in the dark. Circadian efferent nerve
activity was necessary and sufficient to produce normal
daily fluctuations in the level of arrestin mRNA. Light
influenced arrestin mRNA levels only in eyes with intact
and active efferent projections. We conclude that arrestin
mRNA levels in lateral eye photoreceptors are controlled
entirely by efferent nerve activity, and that light exerts
its effects by modulating this output from the circadian
clock. Light-stimulated changes in arrestin mRNA in the
vertebrate retina may likewise require interactions between
light-driven biochemical cascades and clock output.},

In the present study, neural connections between PL neurons and pigment-dispersing factor (PDF)-immunoreactive neurons were examined via immunolight microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy combined with backfills through the cardiac-recurrent nerve. Immunolight microscopy showed that fibers of PL neurons overlapped with PDF-immunoreactive fibers in the dorsolateral region of the superior protocerebral neuropil. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that PDF-immunoreactive fibers formed output synapses with fibers of PL neurons and unlabeled neurons in a region dorsoanteriorly located with respect to the calyx of the mushroom body. The distribution of synaptic connections between PDF-immunoreactive fibers and the fibers of PL neurons was sparse. According to the projection patterns, PDF-immunoreactive fibers with synaptic connections with PL neurons appeared to originate from PDF-immunoreactive neurons with cell bodies at the base of the medulla of the optic lobe (medulla PDF neurons), which are putative circadian clock neurons in P. terraenovae. PDF immunoreactivity was restrictively detected in dense-core vesicles but not in clear synaptic vesicles. The present results suggest that medulla PDF neurons convey time or photoperiodic information to PL neurons for diapause induction through direct synaptic connections. J. Comp.

To examine whether circadian rhythm and photoperiodism share a neuronal mechanism, we focused on the neurons that express neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) in the bean bug, Riptortus pedestris. PDF has been identified as an important regulator of the insect circadian rhythm and is expressed in circadian clock neurons of various insect species. In R. pedestris, PDF immunoreactivity was detected in some clusters of cells and their fibres in the optic lobe and the protocerebrum. cDNA encoding a PDF precursor protein was highly conserved between R. pedestris and many other insects. Differences between day and night were not observed in the immunolabelling intensity in cell bodies of PDFimmunoreactive neurons and pdf mRNA expression levels in the head. Surgical removal of the region containing PDF-immunoreactive cell bodies at the medulla disrupted the photoperiodic regulation of diapause. However, gene suppression of pdf by RNA interference did not affect the photoperiodic response. These results suggest that the region containing PDF-immunoreactive somata is important for the photoperiodic response in R. pedestris, but pdf mRNA expression is probably not required for the response.},

To obtain a tractable model with which to analyze this protein family’s function, we characterized the gene family in Drosophila melanogaster and focused on reproductive phenotypes. The D. melanogaster genome contains 24 M13 class protease homologs, some of which are orthologs of human proteases, including neprilysin. Many are expressed in the reproductive tracts of either sex. Using RNAi we individually targeted the five Nep genes most closely related to vertebrate neprilysin, Nep1-5, to investigate their roles in reproduction. A reduction in Nep1, Nep2, or Nep4 expression in females reduced egg laying. Nep1 and Nep2 are required in the CNS and the spermathecae for wild-type fecundity. Females that are null for Nep2 also show defects as hosts of sperm competition as well as an increased rate of depletion for stored sperm. Furthermore, eggs laid by Nep2 mutant females are fertilized normally, but arrest early in embryonic development. In the male, only Nep1 was required to induce normal patterns of female egg laying. Reduction in the expression of Nep2-5 in the male did not cause any dramatic effects on reproductive fitness, which suggests that these genes are either nonessential for male fertility or perform redundant functions. Our results suggest that, consistent with the functions of neprilysins in mammals, these proteins are also required for reproduction in Drosophila, opening up this model system for further functional analysis of this protein class and their substrates.},

There are 13 subfamilies of Wnt ligand genes and this diverse repertoire appeared very early in metazoan evolution. In this review, we first summarise the known Wnt gene repertoire in various arthropods. Insects appear to have lost several Wnt subfamilies, either generally, such as Wnt3, or in lineage specific patterns, for example, the loss of Wnt7 in Anopheles. In Drosophila and Acyrthosiphon, only seven and six Wnt subfamilies are represented, respectively; however, the finding of nine Wnt genes in Tribolium suggests that arthropods had a larger repertoire ancestrally. We then discuss what is currently known about the expression and developmental function of Wnt ligands in Drosophila and other insects in comparison to other arthropods, such as the spiders Achaearanea and Cupiennius. We conclude that studies of Wnt genes have given us much insight into the developmental roles of some of these ligands. However, given the frequent loss of Wnt genes in insects and the derived development of Drosophila, further studies of these important genes are required in a broader range of arthropods to fully understand their developmental function and evolution.},

To identify other genes involved in JH signaling, we designed a novel Drosophila genetic screen to isolate mutations that derepress JH-mediated br suppression at early larval stages. We found that mutations in three Wnt signaling negative regulators in Drosophila, Axin (Axn), supernumerary limbs (slmb), and naked cuticle (nkd), caused precocious br expression, which could not be blocked by exogenous JHA. A similar phenotype was observed when armadillo (arm), the mediator of Wnt signaling, was overexpressed. qRT-PCR revealed that Met, gce and Kr-h1expression was suppressed in the Axn, slmb and nkd mutants as well as in arm gain-of-function larvae. Furthermore, ectopic expression of gce restored Kr-h1 expression but not Met expression in the arm gain-of-function larvae. Taken together, we conclude that Wnt signaling cross-talks with JH signaling by suppressing transcription of Met and gce, genes that encode for putative JH receptors. The reduced JH activity further induces down-regulation of Kr-h1expression and eventually derepresses br expression in the Drosophila early larval stages.},

	abstract = {Managing metabolic resources is critical for insects during diapause when food sources are limited or unavailable. Insects accumulate reserves prior to diapause, and metabolic depression during diapause promotes reserve conservation. Sufficient reserves must be sequestered to both survive the diapause period and enable postdiapause development that may involve metabolically expensive functions such as metamorphosis or long-distance flight. Nutrient utilization during diapause is a dynamic process, and insects appear capable of sensing their energy reserves and using this information to regulate whether to enter diapause and how long to remain in diapause. Overwintering insects on a tight energy budget are likely to be especially vulnerable to increased temperatures associated with climate change. Molecular mechanisms involved in diapause nutrient regulation remain poorly known, but insulin signaling is likely a major player. We also discuss other possible candidates for diapause-associated nutrient regulation including adipokinetic hormone, neuropeptide F, the cGMP-kinase For, and AMPK.},

	abstract = {This chapter briefly discusses hormonal control of diapause. Diapause is an arrest in development accompanied by a major shutdown in metabolic activity. The evolution of diapause is arguably one of the most critical events bolstering the success of insects. The capacity to periodically shut down development has enabled insects and their arthropod relatives to invade environments that are seasonally hostile. Indeed, very few environments permit continuous insect development. Even in the tropics, where temperatures throughout the year may be compatible with ectotherm development, seasonal patterns of rainfall drive cycles of plant growth that favor insects with the ability to periodically become dormant. Unlike a simple quiescence that is an immediate response to an unfavorable environmental condition, diapause is a genetically programmed response that occurs at a specific stage for each species. Sometimes, the insect will enter diapause at this particular stage in each generation regardless of the environmental conditions it receives—a developmental program referred to as obligatory diapause. Much more frequently, the decision to enter diapause is determined by environmental factors, usually day length, received by that individual or its mother at an earlier developmental stage. This is referred to as facultative diapause.},

	abstract = {Understanding how traits are integrated at the organismal level remains a fundamental problem at the interface of developmental and evolutionary biology. Hormones, regulatory signaling molecules that coordinate multiple developmental and physiological processes, are major determinants underlying phenotypic integration. The probably best example for this is the lipid-like juvenile hormone (JH) in insects. Here we review the manifold effects of JH, the most versatile animal hormone, with an emphasis on the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, an organism amenable to both genetics and endocrinology. JH affects a remarkable number of processes and traits in Drosophila development and life history, including metamorphosis, behavior, reproduction, diapause, stress resistance and aging. While many molecular details underlying JH signaling remain unknown, we argue that studying ‘‘hormonal pleiotropy’’ offers intriguing insights into phenotypic integration and the mechanisms underlying life history evolution. In particular, we illustrate the role of JH as a key mediator of life history trade-offs. BioEssays 27:999–1010, 2005.},

The chemical structure of MF is nearly identical to that of insect juvenile hormone III, differing only by the absence of an epoxide group. The functions of MF in crustaceans have been elusive, in part because the mandibular organs of most species are difficult to ablate. However, three roles of MF have emerged from a growing body of literature. They are (a) stimulation of general protein synthesis; (b) promotion of the molt cycle; and (c) reproduction in both males and females. These functions are not universal; rather, they reflect the diversity of the crustaceans that have been studied to date. This review will synthesize aspects of what is known about MF in crustaceans and outline some current avenues of research.},
